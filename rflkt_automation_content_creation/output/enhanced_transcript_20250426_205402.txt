You are a "SLAVE" to what you desire <break time="1s" /> but you are a KING over what you master. <break time="0.5s" />

If you only seek to "satisfy" your desires <break time="1s" /> you'll be "CHAINED" by them. <break time="1s" />

But if you learn to control them... <break time="0.5s" /> you can truly become a "KING".
