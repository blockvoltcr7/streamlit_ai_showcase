**Jira Story - User Registration Feature**

**High-Level Description:**
As a new user, I want to be able to register on the web application, so that I can have a personal account and gain access to all the functionalities of the resource.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. New users should be directed to a registration page after clicking on the "Sign Up" button.
2. The registration page must capture the following user details: Username, E-mail Address, Password, Confirm Password. 
3. The password and confirm password fields should match to successfully register the user.
4. The user should not be able to proceed with incomplete information.
5. The system should validate that the email is unique and not already registered.
6. After the user fills in the information and click the "Register" button, the system should automatically send a verification email. 
7. Only after the user has verified their email account should they be marked as a registered user.
8. The user should see a success message upon successful registration and redirect to the login screen.
9. Inappropriate or invalid inputs should be flagged with an interactive warning on the form, before submission.

**Sample Test Data:**

1. Test Case 1 (Valid Registration):
   - Username: Testuser 
   - E-mail address: testuser@example.com
   - Password: Testpass1234
   - Confirm password: Testpass1234

**IEEE 829 Test Plan**

**1. Test plan identifier:** TP-001

**2. Introduction:**
This document describes the test plan for user registration functionality on the web application. The goals are to ensure new users can easily register on the application and the system handles invalid input effectively.

**3. Test items:** 
The item under test is the "User Registration" functionality.

**4. Features to be tested:** 
- Navigation to the registration page 
- Forms capturing user details 
- Validation of user inputs
- Email verification process 
- Success message upon successful registration 
- Proper error messages for invalid inputs 

**5. Features not to be tested:** 
Non-related functions and previous screen (before reaching the registration page) 

**6. Approach:**
Given the provided user stories and acceptance criteria, both manual and automation testing approaches will be used. e.g., Selenium for automation, and manually checking correctness of page elements and inputs.

**7. Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- Passed: If upon providing valid and invalid inputs, the system responds as described in the acceptance criteria.
- Failed: If any of the acceptance criteria is not met.

**8. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements:**
- Suspension: If a major defect is found the testing will be suspended.
- Resumption: After the defect has been fixed and formally verified.

**9. Test deliverables:**
- Test plan document
- Test case document
- Defect report document

**10. Testing tasks:**
- Review and understand the requirements
- Design test cases based on acceptance criteria
- Prepare the test environment
- Execute the test cases
- Record and track defects

**11. Environmental needs:**
A suitable test environment mimicking production where the application under test is installed. 

**12. Responsibilities:**
- The SDET is responsible for creating, executing test cases and report bugs.
- The development team is responsible for the resolution of the bugs reported.

**13. Staffing and Training needs:** 
Team members with enough understanding of the system and test automation skills. Training needs will have to be evaluated according to the chosen testing tools.

**14. Schedule:**
Testing Stage: (1 Week)
- Test Plan Creation: 1 Day
- Environment Setup & Test Case Design: 2 Days
- Test Execution & Reporting: 3 Days
- Test summary report creation: 1 Day

**15. Risks and Contingencies:** 
The main risk is that severe defects could delay the process. Contingency will be additional time allocated for bug-fixing.

**16. Approvals:**
Sign off should come from the project manager and the lead business analyst.

QE_Lead (to Human):

The Jira Story is well-written and includes a clear high-level description along with specific and detailed acceptance criteria. All important aspects of the user registration feature are covered, and the edge cases provided in the sample data are also very relevant. Please ensure that tests run on different environments and devices to ensure maximum coverage.

The Test Plan appears to follow the IEEE 829 standard and includes almost all necessary sections for a complete and detailed test plan.

In the section for Test Items, please include the version number, and possibly links to related API documentation or design artifacts. 

In the Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements section, the suspension criteria could be more specific. For example, what qualifies as a 'major' defect? You can state the severity level which will lead to the suspension of testing activities.

In the 'Environmental needs' section, also include details of any specific data/setup required for testing user registration. Please make sure you have test user emails ready for testing purposes.

In the 'Responsibilities' section, it might also be helpful to specify who will be responsible for setting up the test environments, and who will sign off on the completion of testing.

For the 'Risks and Contingencies', it would be better to be more specific about the quantified contingency time.

Lastly, it will be good to include post-mortem meetings or any learning strategies after the completion of the testing process in the test plan.

In conclusion, both the requirements and the test plan are detailed and align well with each other with few mild suggestions for enhancements. The project appears to be in a good state to move forward into testing.
