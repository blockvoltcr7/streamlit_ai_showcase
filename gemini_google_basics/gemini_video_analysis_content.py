"""Video growth-phase analysis using Gemini.

Refactored to follow the same conventions/patterns as `gemini_video_analysis.py`:
 - Explicit video file upload with polling until ACTIVE
 - Streaming response output
 - Clear status prints
 - Parameterized helper for optional extra user input

Usage:
  export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
  python gemini_video_analysis_content.py

Optional:
  from gemini_video_analysis_content import generate
  generate(video_path="carter-video-1.mp4", extra_input="Focus on hook evolution.")

Analyze this screen recording of a creator's last 30 Instagram posts to identify content patterns and performance metrics. I need specific data to fill out a content analysis framework.

Please provide:

## CONTENT TOPICS ANALYSIS
- List the top 3-5 most common topics/themes across all 30 posts
- Count how many posts fall into each topic category
- Note any topic patterns or shifts over time

## FORMAT PERFORMANCE
- Count how many posts are: Reels, Static Posts, Carousels, IGTV
- Which format appears most frequently?
- Note any obvious performance differences between formats (based on visible engagement)

## ENGAGEMENT PATTERNS
- For posts where engagement numbers are visible, note the likes/comments/views
- Identify the 3-5 highest performing posts and their topics/formats
- Calculate average engagement if enough data is visible
- Note any posts that seem to have significantly higher or lower engagement

## POSTING FREQUENCY
- How many posts were made in the time period shown?
- Are there patterns in posting frequency (daily, every few days, clusters)?
- Any gaps or periods of increased activity?

## PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS
- Which days of the week appear most frequently for posts?
- Do certain topics consistently get higher engagement?
- Are there any obvious patterns in what works vs what doesn't?

## VISUAL/STYLE CONSISTENCY
- How consistent is the visual style across posts?
- Any changes in production quality or aesthetic?
- Consistent use of text overlays, colors, or branding elements?

suggest a return format and think hard about the output we should return
