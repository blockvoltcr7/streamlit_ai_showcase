    "key_insights": "The US healthcare system is often seen as 'broken' due to frequent health insurance claim denials. Insurers reject approximately one in seven claims for treatment, and while appeals are possible, doctors often lack the time to help patients, and the process can be complex for individuals. [2, 8] The Fight Health Insurance platform is an open-source AI tool designed to help users generate health insurance appeals, making the process faster and easier. [1, 2, 3, 8] The platform's slogan is \"Make your health insurance company cry, too.\" [2, 5] Many denials can be successfully appealed if the patient knows what to write and how to navigate the process. [2, 8] The platform allows users to scan their denial letters, and the AI drafts appeal letters based on the information. [1, 5] The creator of Fight Health Insurance, Holden Karau, developed the tool after personal experience with claim denials. [4]",
