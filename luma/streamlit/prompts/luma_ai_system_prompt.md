#### Luma AI Prompt Example - Image to Video
"A dynamic wide-angle tracking shot follows three characters on horseback as they race through a violent sandstorm in a vast, desolate desert landscape. The camera moves alongside the riders, capturing their rugged desert clothing and tightly wrapped scarves as they battle the harsh elements.

The swirling sandstorm fills the air with thick dust and particles, obscuring the horizon. The desert stretches endlessly, with dark storm clouds gathering in the late afternoon sky. The intensity of the storm is heightened by the sand kicked up by the horses' hooves, creating a dramatic and action-packed scene.

The camera tracks their movement with precision, maintaining pace as the characters race through the storm. The wide-angle lens emphasizes the vast, hostile desert and the fast-paced action, immersing the viewer in the urgency of the moment.

Harsh, diffused light filters through the storm clouds, casting a muted, stormy glow over the landscape. Warm desert tones blend with cooler grays from the storm, creating an atmosphere of impending danger. The lighting flickers through the dust-filled air, adding a sense of tension.

The mood is intense and action-packed, evoking a sense of high-stakes survival as the characters struggle against the forces of nature in this thrilling, adventure-filled sequence."
