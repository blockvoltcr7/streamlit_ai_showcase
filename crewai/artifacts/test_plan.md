# Financial Report API Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the Financial Report API, a batch job designed to generate a daily comprehensive flat file containing ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) ratings for all accounts within the firm. The test plan aims to ensure that the API meets the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the requirement document and technical design document.

## 2. Test Objectives

The primary objectives of this test plan are to:

- Verify that the API correctly retrieves account data from the Account Management System.
- Validate that the API successfully calls the Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API and retrieves ESG ratings for each account.
- Ensure that the API generates a CSV file with the correct format, data, and naming convention.
- Test the API's ability to handle errors and exceptions gracefully, including retry mechanisms and error logging.
- Assess the API's performance and scalability under various load conditions.
- Evaluate the API's security measures to protect sensitive data.
- Verify the functionality of the alerting system and ensure that alerts are sent promptly to the correct recipients.

| TC_ErrorHandling_03 | Handle data validation errors. | The API handles data validation errors (e.g., incorrect data format) and logs the error. |

**5.1.5 Logging and Monitoring**

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| TC_Logging_01 | Verify that the API logs job start and end times. | The API logs the job start and end times in the designated logging system. |
| TC_Logging_02 | Verify that the API logs the number of accounts processed. | The API logs the total number of accounts processed successfully and unsuccessfully. |
| TC_Logging_03 | Verify that the API logs any errors or exceptions encountered. | The API logs any errors or exceptions encountered during the job execution, including error messages and timestamps. |

**5.1.6 Alerting System**

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| TC_Alerting_01 | Send an alert when the job fails to start at the scheduled time. | The API sends an alert via email and integrates with the firm's incident management system. |
| TC_Alerting_02 | Send an alert when the job exceeds the 4-hour execution window. | The API sends an alert via email and integrates with the firm's incident management system. |
| TC_Alerting_03 | Send an alert when the job encounters a critical error. | The API sends an alert via email and integrates with the firm's incident management system. |
| TC_Alerting_04 | Send an alert when more than 5% of account API calls fail. | The API sends an alert via email and integrates with the firm's incident management system. |
