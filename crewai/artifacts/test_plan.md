This test plan covers the following key areas:

* **Unit Testing:** Test individual components of the batch job, including data retrieval, API calls, error handling, and output file generation.
* **Integration Testing:** Test the interaction between different components of the batch job, ensuring seamless data flow and communication.
* **End-to-End Testing:** Simulate real-world scenarios to validate the entire batch job process from start to finish.
* **Performance Testing:** Evaluate the batch job's performance under various load conditions, including peak account processing volumes.
* **Security Testing:** Test vulnerability to security threats, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and data integrity issues.
* **Regression Testing:** Ensure that changes to the batch job do not negatively impact existing functionality.
* **Usability Testing:** Validate the clarity and accuracy of the output CSV file and the usability of the reporting and analytics features.

**4. Test Environment**

* **Test Data:** Use a representative dataset of active accounts, including a range of account types and ESG rating scenarios.
* **Mock API:** Create a mock version of the ESG Portfolio Analysis API to simulate different API responses, including successful calls, errors, and timeouts.
* **Test Database:** Implement a test database to store account data and job performance metrics for testing purposes.
* **Monitoring and Alerting Tools:** Utilize test instances of monitoring and alerting systems to simulate real-time monitoring and notification scenarios.
