Job fails to start at the scheduled time\n  2. Job exceeds the 4-hour execution window\n  3. Job encounters a critical error and terminates prematurely\n  4. More than 5% of account API calls fail\n- Alerts should be sent via email and integrated with the firm\'s incident management system (e.g., PagerDuty).\n- Alert recipients should include the development team and designated business stakeholders.\n\n### 3.7 Performance Requirements\n- The job must be capable of processing at least 100,000 accounts within the 4-hour window.\n- Implement efficient data handling to minimize memory usage, considering potential growth in the number of accounts.\n- Optimize API calls to minimize unnecessary requests (e.g., by tracking and processing only accounts with changes since the last run).\n\n### 3.8 Error Handling and Recovery\n- Implement a mechanism to track progress, allowing the job to resume from the last successful point in case of interruption.\n- Create a separate error log file detailing any accounts that could not be processed successfully.\n- Develop a manual override process to re-run the job for specific accounts if needed.\n\n### 3.9 Reporting and Analytics\n- Generate a daily summary report including:\n  - Total number of accounts processed\n  - Success rate\n  - Average ESG scores (Overall, E, S, G)\n  - Distribution of primary ESG focus areas\n  - List of accounts with failed processing\n- Store historical job performance data for trend analysis.\n\n### 3.10 Compliance and Audit\n- Ensure all data processing complies with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n- Implement an audit trail to track access to the generated files.\n- Retain historical files and logs for a period specified by the firm\'s data retention policy.\n\n## 4.
