# Technical Design Document for ESG Ratings Batch Job API

## 1. Introduction

This document details the technical design for the ESG Ratings Batch Job API, which will automate the daily generation of a comprehensive ESG ratings report for all active accounts within the firm. This design aims to meet the functional specifications outlined in the Functional Specifications Document for ESG Ratings Batch Job API, ensuring a robust and reliable solution for compliance and reporting purposes.

## 2. System Architecture

The system architecture comprises the following key components:

**2.1. Data Sources**
* **Account Management System:** This system provides the list of active accounts to be processed.
* **ESG Portfolio Analysis API:** This external API provides ESG ratings for each account.

**2.2. Batch Job**
* **Scheduling Service:** Responsible for triggering the batch job execution daily at 5:00 AM Central Time.
* **Data Retrieval and Processing:** This component retrieves account data from the Account Management System and calls the ESG Portfolio Analysis API for each account to obtain ESG ratings.
* **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:** Implements a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient errors encountered during API calls.
* **Parallel Processing:** Utilizes multithreading or multiprocessing to handle multiple account requests concurrently, maximizing efficiency while adhering to API rate limits.
* **Output File Generation:** Generates the CSV file containing ESG ratings and processing status for each account.

**2.3. File Storage and Security**
* **Secure File Storage:** The generated CSV file is stored in a designated secure location within the firm's network or cloud storage.
* **Encryption:** The file is encrypted both in transit and at rest using appropriate encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256).
* **Access Control:** Access to the stored file is restricted to authorized personnel through appropriate permissions and authentication mechanisms.

**2.4. Logging and Monitoring**
* **Logging Framework:** Captures comprehensive logs of job execution, including start and end times, processed accounts, API call success/failure statistics, and any errors or exceptions.
* **Centralized Logging System:** Logs are stored in a centralized logging system for easy access and analysis.
* **Monitoring System:** The batch job is integrated with the firm's monitoring system to track job health, performance metrics, and potential issues.

**2.5. Alerting System**
* **Alerting Framework:** Defines alert triggers based on predefined criteria for job failures, critical errors, or significant API call failure rates.
* **Notification Channels:** Alerts are sent via email and integrated with the firm's incident management system (e.g., PagerDuty).
* **Alert Recipients:** Alerts are sent to the development team and designated business stakeholders.

**2.6. Reporting and Analytics**
* **Daily Summary Report:** Generates a daily report summarizing account processing statistics, success rates, average ESG scores, primary ESG focus distribution, and failed account list.
* **Historical Data Storage:** Job performance data is stored for trend analysis and future insights.

## 3. Technical Details

**3.1. Technologies and Frameworks**

* **Programming Language:** Python (or any suitable language)
* **Data Processing Library:** Pandas (for data manipulation and CSV generation)
* **API Client:** Requests (or similar library) for API calls
* **Scheduling Service:** Cron (or a similar scheduling service)
* **File Storage:** Secure file storage solution (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
* **Encryption Library:** Cryptography (or similar library) for file encryption
* **Logging Framework:** Logging (or a similar logging framework)
* **Monitoring System:** Prometheus, Grafana (or similar monitoring tools)
* **Alerting System:** PagerDuty, Slack (or similar alerting systems)

**3.2. Data Flow**

1. **Schedule Trigger:** The scheduling service triggers the batch job execution at 5:00 AM Central Time.
2. **Account Retrieval:** The batch job fetches the list of active accounts from the Account Management System.
3. **API Calls:** For each account, the batch job calls the ESG Portfolio Analysis API to retrieve ESG ratings.
4. **Error Handling:** If the API call fails, the batch job implements a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.
5. **Parallel Processing:** The batch job uses parallel processing to handle multiple accounts concurrently.
6. **Output File Generation:** The batch job generates a CSV file with the collected ESG ratings, account information, and processing status.
7. **File Storage and Security:** The generated file is securely stored and encrypted.
8. **Logging:** The batch job logs execution details, API calls, and any errors encountered.
9. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitoring tools track job health, performance, and alert stakeholders of issues.
10. **Reporting:** The batch job generates a daily summary report and stores historical performance data.

**3.3. API Integration**

* **Authentication:** The batch job uses the firm's authentication system to securely access the ESG Portfolio Analysis API.
* **API Rate Limits:** The batch job respects the API rate limits to avoid overloading the API.
* **Error Handling:** The batch job implements robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure data integrity and resilience.

**3.4. Security Measures**

* **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data, including account information and ESG ratings, is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
* **Access Control:** Access to the generated file and stored data is restricted to authorized personnel through appropriate permissions and authentication.
* **Secure API Communication:** Secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) are used for all API interactions.

**3.5. Performance Optimization**

* **Parallel Processing:** Parallel processing is implemented to improve efficiency and reduce processing time.
* **Data Caching:** Consider caching frequently accessed data to minimize API calls and improve performance.
* **Database Optimization:** If a database is used for storing data, optimize database queries and indexes for faster retrieval.

**3.6. Error Handling and Recovery**

* **Retry Mechanism:** A retry mechanism with exponential backoff is implemented for transient API errors.
* **Error Logging:** Detailed error logs are maintained to track and analyze failures.
* **Job Resumption:** Implement a mechanism to track progress and allow the job to resume from the last successful state in case of interruption.

## 4. Testing and Deployment

**4.1. Testing**

* **Unit Tests:** Thorough unit tests will be developed to verify the functionality of individual components.
* **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will ensure that different components work together seamlessly.
* **End-to-End Tests:** End-to-end tests will simulate real-world scenarios to validate the entire batch job process.
* **Performance Tests:** Performance tests will be conducted to measure the batch job's processing capabilities and resource usage.
* **Security Tests:** Security tests will be performed to validate data protection measures and ensure compliance with security standards.

**4.2. Deployment**

* **Environment Configuration:** The batch job will be deployed in a production-ready environment with appropriate resource allocation and monitoring.
* **Version Control:** The batch job code will be managed using a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate collaboration.
* **Deployment Automation:** Automated deployment tools will be used to streamline the deployment process and ensure consistency.

## 5. Maintenance and Support
