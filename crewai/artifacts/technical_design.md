# Financial Report API Technical Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical design for the Financial Report API, a batch job designed to generate a daily comprehensive flat file containing ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) ratings for all accounts within the firm. This API will leverage the Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API to provide a firm-wide view of ESG performance.

## 2. System Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following components:

- **Account Management System (AMS):** Provides the list of active accounts.
- **ESG Portfolio Analysis API:** Retrieves ESG ratings for each account.
- **Financial Report API (Batch Job):** Orchestrates the data retrieval, processing, and file generation.
- **Data Storage:** Securely stores the generated CSV file.
- **Logging System:** Logs job execution details, errors, and performance metrics.
- **Monitoring System:** Tracks job health and sends alerts for failures or critical issues.
- **Alerting System:** Notifies relevant stakeholders via email and integrated incident management systems.

## 3. Data Flow Diagram

**Explanation:**

1. The batch job starts at 5:00 AM Central Time.
2. It retrieves a list of active accounts from the Account Management System.
3. For each account, the batch job calls the ESG Portfolio Analysis API to fetch ESG ratings.
4. The API responses are processed and stored in memory.
5. A CSV file is generated containing the account details and ESG ratings.
6. The CSV file is encrypted and stored in a secure location.
7. Logs are written to a centralized logging system.
8. The monitoring system tracks job execution and sends alerts for failures or issues.

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 Scheduling and Execution

- The batch job will be scheduled using a cron job or similar mechanism to run daily at 5:00 AM Central Time.
- The job will have a 4-hour execution window, terminating at 9:00 AM Central Time if not completed.
- A dedicated process will monitor the job's execution status and send alerts if it fails to start or exceeds the time limit.

### 4.2 Data Retrieval and Processing

- **Account Retrieval:**
    - The batch job will use a RESTful API to retrieve a list of active accounts from the Account Management System.
    - The API call will handle pagination to retrieve all accounts efficiently.
    - The account data will be stored in memory as a list of account IDs and names.
- **ESG Ratings Retrieval:**
    - For each account, the batch job will call the Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API to retrieve ESG ratings.
    - The API calls will be made using a dedicated HTTP client library with built-in support for retry mechanisms and rate limiting.
    - The retry mechanism will implement exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API in case of failures.
    - Persistent failures for individual accounts will be logged with the specific error message.
- **Parallel Processing:**
    - The batch job will utilize multithreading to process multiple API calls concurrently, maximizing efficiency and reducing execution time.
    - The number of threads will be configured to balance performance and resource utilization while adhering to API rate limits.
    - A thread pool will be used to manage the threads and ensure efficient resource management.

### 4.3 Output File Generation

- **CSV File Format:**
    - The CSV file will contain the following columns:
        - Account ID
        - Account Name
        - Overall ESG Score
        - Environmental Score
        - Social Score
        - Governance Score
        - Primary ESG Focus
        - Primary Focus Score
        - Analysis Date
        - Processing Status (Successful/Failed/Partial)
    - The file will include a header row with column names.
    - The naming convention for the file will be "FirmESGRatings_YYYYMMDD.csv".
    - Decimal values will be formatted consistently to two decimal places.
    - For accounts with failed API calls, the ESG fields will be populated with "N/A" and the Processing Status will be set to "Failed".
- **File Generation:**
    - The CSV file will be generated using a dedicated library for CSV formatting and writing.
    - The file will be written to a temporary location before being moved to the secure storage location.

### 4.4 File Storage and Security

- **Storage Location:**
    - The generated CSV file will be stored in a designated secure location on the firm's network or in a cloud storage service.
    - The choice of location will depend on security policies and infrastructure considerations.
- **Encryption:**
    - The file will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using AES-256 encryption).
    - Encryption will be implemented using industry-standard cryptographic libraries and algorithms.
- **Access Control:**
    - Access to the stored file will be restricted to authorized personnel only.
    - Access permissions will be configured to enforce these restrictions.

### 4.5 Logging and Monitoring

- **Logging:**
    - The batch job will implement comprehensive logging throughout its execution.
    - Logs will include the following information:
        - Job start and end times
        - Number of accounts processed
        - Number of successful/failed/partial API calls
        - Any errors or exceptions encountered
    - Logs will be stored in a centralized logging system for easy access and analysis.
- **Monitoring:**
    - The batch job will be integrated with the firm's monitoring system to track its performance and health.
    - The monitoring system will track metrics such as job execution time, success rate, and resource utilization.
    - Alerts will be triggered for critical issues or performance degradation.

### 4.6 Alerting System

- **Alert Triggers:**
    - Alerts will be sent in the following scenarios:
        - Job fails to start at the scheduled time
        - Job exceeds the 4-hour execution window
        - Job encounters a critical error and terminates prematurely
        - More than 5% of account API calls fail
- **Alert Delivery:**
    - Alerts will be sent via email and integrated with the firm's incident management system (e.g., PagerDuty).
    - Alert recipients will include the development team and designated business stakeholders.

### 4.7 Performance Requirements

- **Account Processing Volume:**
    - The batch job must be capable of processing at least 100,000 accounts within the 4-hour window.
