# Financial Report API Technical Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical design of the Financial Report API, a batch job responsible for generating a daily report containing ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) ratings for all accounts within the firm. The API will leverage the Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API to retrieve the ratings and generate a comprehensive CSV file for authorized personnel.

## 2. System Architecture

**2.1 High-Level Architecture:**

The system architecture is comprised of the following components:

- **Account Management System:** This system stores information about all firm accounts. The batch job will query this system to retrieve a list of active accounts.
- **ESG Portfolio Analysis API:** This API provides access to ESG ratings for individual accounts. The batch job will call this API to retrieve ESG data for each account.
- **Batch Job:** This is the core component of the system, responsible for:
    - Retrieving account information from the Account Management System.
    - Calling the ESG Portfolio Analysis API to fetch ESG ratings for each account.
    - Processing and transforming the data.
    - Generating the output CSV file.
    - Handling errors and logging.
    - Monitoring job execution and sending alerts.
- **File Storage:** The generated CSV file will be stored securely in a designated location on the firm's network or cloud storage.
- **Logging System:** The batch job will log various events, including job execution details, API call results, errors, and exceptions.
- **Monitoring System:** This system will track the job's performance, health, and execution status.
- **Alerting System:** This system will send notifications to the development team and business stakeholders in case of job failures or critical issues.

**2.2 Data Flow:**

1. The batch job starts at 5:00 AM Central Time.
2. The batch job queries the Account Management System for a list of active accounts.
3. For each account, the batch job calls the ESG Portfolio Analysis API to retrieve ESG ratings.
4. The batch job processes the retrieved data and generates a CSV file containing account details and ESG scores.
5. The CSV file is securely stored in a designated location.
6. The batch job logs various events related to its execution.
7. The monitoring system tracks the job's performance and health.
8. The alerting system sends notifications in case of failures or critical issues.

## 3. Technical Components

**3.1 Batch Job Implementation:**

- **Programming Language:** Python (due to its extensive libraries for API interactions, data processing, and batch job scheduling).
- **Job Scheduler:** Apache Airflow (for robust scheduling, workflow management, and monitoring).
- **Data Processing:** Pandas library (for efficient data manipulation and analysis).
- **API Client:** Requests library (for making HTTP requests to the ESG Portfolio Analysis API).
- **Error Handling:** Retry mechanism with exponential backoff (for handling API errors and timeouts).
- **Logging:** Logging library (e.g., Python's built-in `logging` module or a specialized logging framework like `structlog`) for capturing events and errors.

**3.2 Data Retrieval and Processing:**

- **Account Retrieval:** The batch job will use the Account Management System's API or database to retrieve a list of active accounts.
- **ESG Data Retrieval:** The batch job will use the Requests library to call the ESG Portfolio Analysis API, providing the account ID as a parameter.
- **Data Transformation:** The retrieved data will be processed and transformed using Pandas library to generate the required CSV output format.

**3.3 Output File Generation:**

- **Format:** CSV (Comma-Separated Values).
- **File Naming Convention:** "FirmESGRatings_YYYYMMDD.csv".
- **Columns:**
    - Account ID
    - Account Name
    - Overall ESG Score
    - Environmental Score
    - Social Score
    - Governance Score
    - Primary ESG Focus
    - Primary Focus Score
    - Analysis Date
    - Processing Status (Successful/Failed/Partial)
- **Data Formatting:** Decimal values will be formatted consistently to two decimal places.

**3.4 File Storage and Security:**

- **Storage Location:** Secure location on the firm's network or cloud storage.
- **Encryption:** The file will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using a strong encryption algorithm).
- **Access Permissions:** Only authorized personnel will have access to the file.

**3.5 Logging and Monitoring:**

- **Logging System:** A centralized logging system will be used to capture logs from the batch job.
- **Log Data:**
    - Job start and end times
    - Number of accounts processed
    - Number of successful/failed/partial API calls
    - Any errors or exceptions encountered
- **Monitoring System:** The job will be integrated with the firm's monitoring system to track its performance and health.

**3.6 Alerting System:**

- **Alert Scenarios:**
    - Job fails to start at the scheduled time.
    - Job exceeds the 4-hour execution window.
    - Job encounters a critical error and terminates prematurely.
    - More than 5% of account API calls fail.
- **Alert Channels:** Email notifications and integration with the firm's incident management system (e.g., PagerDuty).
- **Alert Recipients:** Development team and designated business stakeholders.

**3.7 Performance Optimization:**

- **Parallel Processing:** Multithreading or distributed computing frameworks will be used to handle multiple accounts simultaneously, respecting API rate limits.
- **Data Handling:** Efficient data handling techniques will be employed to minimize memory usage and optimize performance.
- **API Call Optimization:** The batch job will track changes in account data since the last run and only process accounts with updates, minimizing unnecessary API calls.

**3.8 Error Handling and Recovery:**

- **Progress Tracking:** The batch job will track its progress and store checkpoints to resume from the last successful point in case of interruption.
- **Error Logging:** A separate error log file will be generated detailing any accounts that could not be processed successfully.
- **Manual Override:** A manual override process will be implemented to re-run the job for specific accounts if needed.

**3.9 Reporting and Analytics:**

- **Daily Summary Report:** The batch job will generate a daily summary report containing:
    - Total number of accounts processed.
    - Success rate.
    - Average ESG scores (Overall, E, S, G).
    - Distribution of primary ESG focus areas.
    - List of accounts with failed processing.
- **Historical Data:** Historical job performance data will be stored for trend analysis.

**3.10 Compliance and Audit:**

- **Data Privacy:** The batch job will comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- **Audit Trail:** An audit trail will be implemented to track access to the generated files.
- **Data Retention:** Historical files and logs will be retained for a period specified by the firm's data retention policy.

## 4. Testing and Deployment

**4.1 Testing:**

- **Unit Tests:** Individual components of the batch job will be tested to ensure they function correctly.
- **Integration Tests:** The batch job will be tested in an integrated environment to verify the interaction between different components.
- **Performance Tests:** The batch job will be tested to ensure it can handle the expected volume of accounts within the specified time frame.
- **Security Tests:** The system will be tested to validate data protection measures and ensure secure access to the generated file.
- **Failure Scenarios:** The batch job will be tested with various failure scenarios to ensure proper error handling and alerting.

**4.2 Deployment:**

- The batch job will be deployed to a production environment in accordance with the firm's deployment procedures.
- Monitoring and alerting systems will be configured to track the job's performance and health.

## 5. Documentation
