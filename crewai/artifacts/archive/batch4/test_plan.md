# Financial Report API Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive test plan for the Financial Report API, a batch job responsible for generating a daily report containing ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) ratings for all accounts within the firm. The test plan aims to ensure that the API meets all functional, performance, security, and reliability requirements.

## 2. Test Objectives

The primary objectives of this test plan are to:

- Verify that the API correctly retrieves account data from the Account Management System.
- Ensure that the API successfully calls the ESG Portfolio Analysis API and retrieves ESG ratings for each account.
- Validate the accuracy and consistency of the generated CSV file.
- Test the performance of the API to ensure it can process the expected volume of accounts within the specified time frame.
- Assess the security of the API and the generated data.
- Evaluate the error handling and alerting mechanisms in various failure scenarios.
- Confirm that the API complies with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

## 3. Test Scope

This test plan covers the following aspects of the Financial Report API:

- **Functional Testing:**
    - Account retrieval from the Account Management System.
    - ESG data retrieval from the ESG Portfolio Analysis API.
    - Data processing and transformation.
    - CSV file generation with correct data and formatting.
    - Error handling and logging.
    - Alerting mechanisms.
- **Performance Testing:**
    - Throughput: Number of accounts processed per unit time.
    - Response Time: Time taken to process individual accounts.
    - Resource Utilization: Memory and CPU usage.
- **Security Testing:**
    - Authentication and authorization: Secure access to the API and generated data.
    - Data encryption in transit and at rest.
    - Access control and permissions.
- **Reliability Testing:**
    - Job scheduling and execution.
    - Error recovery and resumption.
    - Alerting system effectiveness.
- **Compliance Testing:**
    - GDPR and CCPA compliance.
    - Audit trail verification.
    - Data retention policy adherence.

## 4. Test Environment

The testing will be conducted in a dedicated test environment that replicates the production environment as closely as possible. This environment will include:

- A test instance of the Account Management System.
- A mock ESG Portfolio Analysis API (or access to a test environment of the real API).
- A test instance of the batch job code.
- A test file storage location.
- A test logging system.
- A test monitoring and alerting system.

## 5. Test Cases

### 5.1 Functional Testing

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| FT-01 | Retrieve a list of active accounts from the Account Management System. | The API successfully retrieves a list of active accounts. |
| FT-02 | Call the ESG Portfolio Analysis API for a specific account and retrieve ESG ratings. | The API successfully calls the ESG Portfolio Analysis API and retrieves valid ESG ratings for the specified account. |
| FT-03 | Process retrieved data and generate a CSV file with correct data and formatting. | The CSV file is generated correctly with all required columns and data values formatted as specified. |
| FT-04 | Handle API errors or timeouts gracefully, implementing a retry mechanism. | The API handles errors and timeouts by retrying the API call with exponential backoff. |
| FT-05 | Log various events related to job execution, API calls, and errors. | The API logs relevant events, including job start and end times, API call results, and error messages. |
| FT-06 | Send alerts in case of job failures or critical issues. | Alerts are sent promptly to the correct recipients via email and the firm's incident management system. |
| FT-07 | Handle accounts with missing or invalid data. | The API handles accounts with missing or invalid data by populating the ESG fields with "N/A" and setting the Processing Status to "Failed". |
| FT-08 | Ensure data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations. | The API adheres to GDPR and CCPA requirements and processes data securely. |

### 5.2 Performance Testing

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| PT-01 | Process a large number of accounts (e.g., 100,000) and measure the time taken. | The API processes the specified number of accounts within the 4-hour time window. |
| PT-02 | Measure the response time for processing individual accounts. | The API processes individual accounts within an acceptable response time. |
| PT-03 | Monitor memory and CPU usage during job execution. | The API uses resources efficiently and does not exceed resource limits. |

### 5.3 Security Testing

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| ST-01 | Test authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure API access. | Only authorized personnel can access the API and generated data. |
| ST-02 | Verify data encryption in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using a strong encryption algorithm). | The API and generated data are encrypted securely both in transit and at rest. |
| ST-03 | Test access control and permissions to ensure only authorized personnel can access the generated file. | Only authorized personnel can access the generated CSV file. |

### 5.4 Reliability Testing

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| RT-01 | Test job scheduling and execution to ensure it runs at the scheduled time. | The API runs successfully at 5:00 AM Central Time every day. |
| RT-02 | Simulate job interruptions and test error recovery and resumption. | The API resumes from the last successful point in case of interruption. |
| RT-03 | Test the alerting system to ensure it sends alerts promptly and to the correct recipients. | Alerts are sent promptly and to the correct recipients in case of job failures or critical issues. |

### 5.5 Compliance Testing

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| CT-01 | Verify compliance with GDPR and CCPA requirements. | The API processes data in accordance with GDPR and CCPA regulations. |
| CT-02 | Test the audit trail to ensure it tracks access to the generated files. | The API maintains an audit trail that accurately records access to the generated CSV file. |
| CT-03 | Verify adherence to the firm's data retention policy. | The API retains historical files and logs for the specified period. |

## 6. Test Execution

### 6.1 Test Environment Setup

- Set up the test environment with all required components.
- Configure the test instance of the batch job code with appropriate settings.
- Prepare test data for the Account Management System and the ESG Portfolio Analysis API.

### 6.2 Test Case Execution

- Execute each test case systematically and document the results.
- Use automated test scripts whenever possible to ensure consistency and efficiency.
- Manually verify the results of test cases that cannot be automated.

### 6.3 Defect Tracking

- Identify and document any defects or issues encountered during testing.
- Assign each defect a unique identifier and track its status (e.g., open, assigned, fixed, closed).
- Communicate defects to the development team for resolution.

## 7. Test Reporting

- Prepare a comprehensive test report summarizing the test results.
- Include the following information in the report:
    - Test plan objectives and scope.
    - Test environment details.
    - List of test cases executed.
    - Test case results, including any defects identified.
    - Overall test summary and conclusions.
    - Recommendations for further testing or improvements.

## 8. Success Criteria

The Financial Report API is considered successful if it passes all test cases and meets the following criteria:

- **Functional Accuracy:** The API correctly retrieves data, processes it, and generates the CSV file with accurate and consistent information.
- **Performance Efficiency:** The API processes the expected volume of accounts within the specified time frame and uses resources efficiently.
- **Security Robustness:** The API and generated data are protected by appropriate security measures, including authentication, authorization, and encryption.
- **Reliability and Stability:** The API runs reliably and consistently, with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
