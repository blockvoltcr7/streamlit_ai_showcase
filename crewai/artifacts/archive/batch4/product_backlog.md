# ESG Ratings Batch Job Product Backlog

## Epic 1: Job Scheduling and Execution

- **User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the batch job to run automatically every day at 5:00 AM Central Time, so that the ESG ratings are updated daily without manual intervention.
- **Task:** Implement a scheduled job using a job scheduler or orchestration tool (e.g., Cron, Apache Airflow, Azure Data Factory).
- **Task:** Set up monitoring to ensure the job starts at the scheduled time and send alerts if it fails to start.
- **Task:** Configure the job to terminate after 4 hours if it has not completed and send an alert to the development team.

## Epic 2: Data Retrieval and Processing

- **User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to retrieve a list of all active accounts from the firm's account management system, so that I can process ESG ratings for each account.
- **Task:** Integrate with the account management system API or database to fetch active accounts.
- **User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to call the ESG Portfolio Analysis API to retrieve ESG ratings for each account, so that I can include the ratings in the output file.
- **Task:** Implement API calls to the ESG Portfolio Analysis API, handling errors and timeouts gracefully with a retry mechanism (3 attempts with exponential backoff).
- **Task:** Log any persistent failures for individual accounts.
- **User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to process multiple accounts simultaneously while respecting API rate limits, so that the job can complete within the 4-hour window.
- **Task:** Implement parallel processing using multithreading or distributed computing (e.g., Apache Spark, Dask).
- **Task:** Monitor API rate limits and adjust parallel processing accordingly.

## Epic 3: Output File Generation

- **User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to receive a CSV file with ESG ratings for all accounts, including specific columns and formatting, so that I can easily analyze the firm's ESG performance.
- **Task:** Generate a CSV file with the specified columns and formatting.
- **Task:** Use the naming convention "FirmESGRatings_YYYYMMDD.csv" for the output file.
- **Task:** Populate the ESG fields with "N/A" and set the Processing Status to "Failed" for accounts where API calls failed.
- **User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the CSV file to be encrypted and stored securely, so that sensitive data is protected.
- **Task:** Implement encryption for the CSV file both in transit and at rest.
- **Task:** Store the generated file in a designated secure location on the firm's network or cloud storage.
- **Task:** Set appropriate access permissions for the file.

## Epic 4: Logging and Monitoring

- **User Story:** As a support engineer, I want comprehensive logging throughout the job execution, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor performance.
- **Task:** Implement logging for job start and end times, number of accounts processed, successful/failed/partial API calls, and any errors or exceptions encountered.
- **Task:** Store logs in a centralized logging system.
- **Task:** Integrate with the firm's monitoring system to track job performance and health.

## Epic 5: Alerting System

- **User Story:** As a support engineer, I want to receive alerts in specific scenarios, so that I can take appropriate action and keep stakeholders informed.
- **Task:** Implement an alerting system that sends notifications in the following scenarios:
  - Job fails to start at the scheduled time
  - Job exceeds the 4-hour execution window
  - Job encounters a critical error and terminates prematurely
  - More than 5% of account API calls fail
- **Task:** Send alerts via email and integrate with the firm's incident management system (e.g., PagerDuty).
- **Task:** Configure alert recipients to include the development team and designated business stakeholders.

## Epic 6: Performance and Optimization

- **User Story:** As a data engineer, I want the job to be able to process at least 100,000 accounts within the 4-hour window, so that it can handle the firm's current and future account volume
