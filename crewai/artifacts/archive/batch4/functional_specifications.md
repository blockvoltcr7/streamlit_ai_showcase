# Functional Specifications Document for Financial Report API

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the detailed functional specifications for the Financial Report API, which is designed to generate a daily batch job that collects, processes, and outputs ESG ratings for all accounts within the firm.

## 2. Objective
To provide authorized personnel with a daily updated, comprehensive overview of the firm's ESG performance across all accounts, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and facilitating informed decision-making.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Scheduling and Execution
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-001
  - **Description:** The batch job must run automatically every day at 5:00 AM Central Time.
  - **Implementation:** Utilize a job scheduler (e.g., Cron, Apache Airflow, Azure Data Factory) to automate the execution.
  
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-002
  - **Description:** The job should complete within a 4-hour window.
  - **Implementation:** Monitor execution time and implement termination logic at 9:00 AM Central Time if the job is still running.

- **Requirement ID:** REQ-003
  - **Description:** An alert should be sent to the development team if the job fails to start or exceeds the execution time.
  - **Implementation:** Integrate with the firm's alerting system to notify stakeholders.

### 3.2 Data Retrieval and Processing
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-004
  - **Description:** Query the firm's account management system to retrieve a list of all active accounts.
  - **Implementation:** Develop an integration using the account management API or database.

- **Requirement ID:** REQ-005
  - **Description:** Call the ESG Portfolio Analysis API to retrieve ESG ratings for each account.
  - **Implementation:** Implement a retry mechanism for API calls with 3 attempts and exponential backoff for error handling.

- **Requirement ID:** REQ-006
  - **Description:** Log any persistent failures for individual accounts.
  - **Implementation:** Create a logging mechanism to capture failed API calls.

- **Requirement ID:** REQ-007
  - **Description:** Enable parallel processing to handle multiple accounts simultaneously while respecting API rate limits.
  - **Implementation:** Use multithreading or distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark, Dask) to optimize performance.

### 3.3 Output File Generation
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-008
  - **Description:** Generate a CSV file with specified columns and formatting.
  - **Implementation:** Ensure the CSV file includes headers and follows the naming convention "FirmESGRatings_YYYYMMDD.csv".

- **Requirement ID:** REQ-009
  - **Description:** Populate failed API calls with "N/A" and set the Processing Status to "Failed".
  - **Implementation:** Implement conditional logic in the output generation process.

### 3.4 File Storage and Security
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-010
  - **Description:** Store the generated file securely and implement encryption.
  - **Implementation:** Encrypt the file during transit and at rest, and set access permissions to restrict access to authorized personnel.

### 3.5 Logging and Monitoring
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-011
  - **Description:** Implement comprehensive logging throughout the job execution.
  - **Implementation:** Capture job start and end times, account processing counts, and error logs in a centralized logging system.

### 3.6 Alerting System
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-012
  - **Description:** Send alerts in specific scenarios related to job execution.
  - **Implementation:** Configure alerts for job start failures, execution time breaches, critical errors, and high failure rates, integrated with the firm’s incident management system.

### 3.7 Performance Requirements
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-013
  - **Description:** Process at least 100,000 accounts within the 4-hour window.
  - **Implementation:** Optimize data handling and API calls to ensure efficiency and scalability.

### 3.8 Error Handling and Recovery
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-014
  - **Description:** Implement a mechanism to track progress and resume from the last successful point in case of interruption.
  - **Implementation:** Ensure that error logs are generated for accounts that fail processing.

### 3.9 Reporting and Analytics
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-015
  - **Description:** Generate a daily summary report of job performance.
  - **Implementation:** Include metrics such as total accounts processed, success rates, and lists of accounts with failed processing.

### 3.10 Compliance and Audit
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-016
  - **Description:** Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and implement an audit trail.
  - **Implementation:** Retain historical files and logs per the firm’s data retention policy.

## 4. Integration Points
- **Integration with Account Management System:** To retrieve active accounts.
- **Integration with ESG Portfolio Analysis API:** To fetch ESG ratings.
- **Integration with Authentication System:** For secure API access.
- **Integration with Monitoring and Alerting Systems:** For job health tracking.

## 5. Testing Requirements
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-017
  - **Description:** Develop a comprehensive test suite for validation.
  - **Implementation:** Conduct unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and security tests.

## 6. Documentation
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-018
  - **Description:** Provide detailed technical documentation and user guides.
  - **Implementation:** Include system architecture, data flow diagrams, and alert system documentation.

## 7. Training and Support
- **Requirement ID:** REQ-019
  - **Description:** Conduct training for the operations team.
  - **Implementation:** Establish a support process for handling inquiries related to the batch job and its output.

## 8. Success Criteria
- **Success Metrics:**
  - The batch job runs successfully at the scheduled time with a reliability of 99.9%.
  - All active accounts are processed within the specified time frame.
  - The output file is accurate and meets stakeholder requirements.
  - Alerts are sent promptly for any critical issues.

## 9. Future Considerations
