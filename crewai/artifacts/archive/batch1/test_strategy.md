# High-Level Test Strategy Document for Customized Financial Report API

## Introduction
This high-level test strategy document outlines the approach to ensure the Customized Financial Report API meets the defined business requirements and delivers a high-quality product. The API is designed to empower financial analysts to generate customized financial reports efficiently.

## Objectives
- Ensure the API adheres to all functional and non-functional requirements.
- Validate input parameters and error handling mechanisms.
- Confirm the accuracy and correctness of generated financial reports.
- Evaluate performance, security, and scalability of the API.

## Test Scope
The scope of testing will include:
- **Functional Testing**: Verification of API endpoints, request validation, and response structures.
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Performance, security, and stress testing to ensure API reliability and robustness.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensuring that changes to the codebase do not adversely affect existing functionality.

## Test Types
- **Manual Testing**: To explore edge cases and validate user scenarios.
- **Automated Testing**: For regression testing and continuous integration pipelines, utilizing tools like JUnit and RestAssured.
- **Performance Testing**: Using tools such as JMeter to assess the API's performance under load.
- **Security Testing**: Employing OWASP ZAP to identify vulnerabilities and ensure secure API communication.

## Test Tools
- **Postman**: For manual API testing and exploratory testing.
- **JUnit & RestAssured**: For automated functional and regression tests.
- **JMeter**: For performance and load testing.
- **OWASP ZAP**: For security testing and vulnerability scans.
- **Test Management Tool**: Such as TestRail for tracking test cases and reporting.

## Environments
- **Development Environment**: For initial development and unit testing.
- **Testing Environment**: For comprehensive testing cycles, including functional and non-functional tests.
- **Staging Environment**: To simulate production-like conditions for final validation before release.

## Test Deliverables
- **Test Case Documentation**: Comprehensive test cases covering all functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Test Execution Reports**: Summary reports detailing the outcomes of test executions.
- **Defect Logs**: Documentation of any defects identified during testing, including severity and status.
- **Final Test Summary Report**: A detailed report summarizing the overall testing process, results, and quality assessment.

## Schedule
- **Test Planning Phase**: [Start Date] to [End Date]
- **Test Execution Phase**: [Start Date] to [End Date]
- **Test Closure Phase**: [Start Date] to [End Date]

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Changes in API specifications during the testing phase.
  - **Mitigation**: Regular reviews with stakeholders to keep test cases aligned with specifications.
- **Risk**: Incomplete requirements leading to missed scenarios.
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct thorough requirement reviews and involve stakeholders in test case creation.

## Conclusion
This high-level test strategy document provides a comprehensive approach to validating the Customized Financial Report API. By adhering to this strategy, we will ensure that the API meets its functional and non-functional requirements, providing a reliable and efficient tool for financial analysts.

## Alignment with Business Requirements
The testing strategy will be closely aligned with the business requirements outlined in the Business Requirements Document, ensuring all acceptance criteria and non-functional requirements are thoroughly validated.
