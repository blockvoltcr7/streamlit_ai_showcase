# Comprehensive Test Plan for Customized Financial Report API

## Introduction
This test plan outlines the strategy, scope, resources, and schedule for testing the Customized Financial Report API. The API allows financial analysts to generate customized financial reports based on specific criteria, and this testing will ensure it meets all functional and non-functional requirements as outlined in the Business Requirements Document and Technical Design Document.

## Objectives
- Validate all functional requirements of the API.
- Validate all non-functional requirements including performance, availability, and security.
- Ensure robust error handling and input validation.
- Verify the correctness and accuracy of generated reports.

## Scope
The testing will cover the following areas:
- **Functional Testing**: Validate API endpoints, request/response structures, input validations, and business logic.
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Assess performance, security, and error handling.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that new changes do not affect existing functionality.

## Test Strategy
- **Test Types**: Manual testing for exploratory and edge cases, automated testing for regression and performance tests.
- **Tools**: Postman for manual API testing, JUnit and RestAssured for automated API testing, JMeter for performance testing, and OWASP ZAP for security testing.
- **Environments**: Development, Testing, and Staging environments.

## Test Cases

### 1. Functional Test Cases

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Input | Expected Output | Status |
|---------------|------------------|-------|------------------|--------|
| TC-FR-001 | Validate API Endpoint | POST `/api/v1/reports/custom` | Valid request body | HTTP 200 with valid report data |  |
| TC-FR-002 | Validate Required Fields | POST `/api/v1/reports/custom` | Missing 'report_type' | HTTP 400 with error message |  |
| TC-FR-003 | Validate Date Range | POST `/api/v1/reports/custom` | start_date > end_date | HTTP 400 with error message |  |
| TC-FR-004 | Validate Date Range Limit | POST `/api/v1/reports/custom` | Date range exceeds 5 years | HTTP 400 with error message |  |
| TC-FR-005 | Validate Account Limit | POST `/api/v1/reports/custom` | More than 50 accounts | HTTP 400 with error message |  |
| TC-FR-006 | Validate Input Types | POST `/api/v1/reports/custom` | Invalid data types in request | HTTP 400 with error message |  |
| TC-FR-007 | Generate Income Statement | POST `/api/v1/reports/custom` | Valid income statement request | HTTP 200 with proper JSON report |  |
| TC-FR-008 | Generate Balance Sheet | POST `/api/v1/reports/custom` | Valid balance sheet request | HTTP 200 with proper JSON report |  |
| TC-FR-009 | Handle Multiple Currencies | POST `/api/v1/reports/custom` | Valid request with multiple currencies | HTTP 200 with converted currency values |  |
| TC-FR-010 | Include Subtotals | POST `/api/v1/reports/custom` | Valid request with include_subtotals=true | HTTP 200 with subtotal data in report |  |
| TC-FR-011 | Return Partial Results | POST `/api/v1/reports/custom` | Request data that is partially unavailable | HTTP 207 with warnings |  |

### 2. Non-Functional Test Cases

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Input | Expected Output | Status |
|---------------|------------------|-------|------------------|--------|
| TC-NF-001 | Performance Test for 1 Year Data | Valid request with 1 year range | Response time < 5 seconds |  |
| TC-NF-002 | Concurrent Request Handling | 100 concurrent requests | All requests should be processed |  |
| TC-NF-003 | API Availability | Continuous requests for 24 hours | Uptime should be 99.9% |  |
| TC-NF-004 | Security Test | Attempt unauthorized access | HTTP 403 Forbidden |  |
| TC-NF-005 | Log Verification | Send requests to the API | Logs should capture all requests and responses |  |
| TC-NF-006 | Rate Limiting Test | Exceed rate limit | HTTP 429 Too Many Requests |  |

## Resources
- **Testers**: QA Team
- **Environment Setup**: Separate testing environment with staging data.
- **Reporting Tools**: Test management tool (e.g., qtest) for tracking and reporting.

## Schedule
- **Test Planning**: [Start Date] to [End Date]
- **Test Execution**: [Start Date] to [End Date]
- **Test Closure**: [Start Date] to [End Date]

## Risks
- Changes in the database structure or business logic during testing may require re-testing.
- Incomplete or unclear requirements could lead to missed test scenarios.

## Conclusion
This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the Customized Financial Report API meets its requirements and functions correctly. By executing the outlined tests and strategies, we will validate both functional and non-functional aspects, ensuring high-quality deliverables for our users.
