# ESG Ratings Batch Job Product Backlog

## Epic: Develop ESG Ratings Batch Job

### User Stories

#### Scheduling and Execution

- **Story:** As an operations engineer, I want the batch job to run automatically at 5:00 AM Central Time every day, so that the ESG ratings are updated daily.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Configure job scheduler to trigger the batch job at 5:00 AM Central Time daily.
    - Implement monitoring to ensure the job starts as scheduled.
    - Create an alert for when the job fails to start at the scheduled time.

- **Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the batch job to complete within a 4-hour window, so that the ESG data is available at the start of the business day.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Implement a timeout mechanism to terminate the job if it exceeds the 4-hour window.
    - Create an alert for when the job exceeds the 4-hour execution window.

#### Data Retrieval and Processing

- **Story:** As a data analyst, I want the batch job to retrieve a list of all active accounts from the account management system, so that ESG ratings can be generated for each account.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Integrate with the account management system API to fetch the list of active accounts.
    - Implement error handling for API failures or timeouts.

- **Story:** As a data engineer, I want the batch job to retrieve ESG ratings for each account from the ESG Portfolio Analysis API, so that the ratings data is up-to-date.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Integrate with the ESG Portfolio Analysis API to fetch ESG ratings for each account.
    - Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for API failures or timeouts.
    - Log any persistent failures for individual accounts.
    - Implement parallel processing to handle multiple accounts simultaneously while respecting API rate limits.

#### Output File Generation

- **Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the batch job to generate a CSV file with the specified columns and format, so that I can easily analyze the firm's ESG performance.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Implement logic to generate the CSV file with the required columns and format.
    - Ensure decimal values are formatted consistently.
    - Use the specified naming convention for the output file.
    - Populate ESG fields with "N/A" and set Processing Status to "Failed" for accounts with API failures.

#### File Storage and Security

- **Story:** As a security analyst, I want the generated CSV file to be stored securely with appropriate access permissions, so that the ESG data is protected.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Implement encryption for the file both in transit and at rest.
    - Store the file in a designated secure location on the firm's network or cloud storage.
    - Set appropriate access permissions to restrict access to authorized personnel only.

#### Logging and Monitoring

- **Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive logging throughout the job execution, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot issues effectively.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Implement logging for job start and end times, number of accounts processed, API call statistics, and errors/exceptions.
    - Store logs in a centralized logging system.
    - Integrate with the firm's monitoring system to track job performance and health.

#### Alerting System

- **Story:** As an operations engineer, I want an alerting system that notifies the appropriate teams in case of job failures or issues, so that we can promptly address and resolve them.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Implement alerts for job failures to start, exceeding execution window, critical errors, and high API failure rates.
    - Send alerts via email and integrate with the firm's incident management system.
    - Configure alert recipients to include the development team and designated business stakeholders.

#### Performance Requirements

- **Story:** As a performance analyst, I want the batch job to be optimized for processing a large number of accounts within the time window, so that we can accommodate future growth.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Implement efficient data handling to minimize memory usage.
    - Optimize API calls to minimize unnecessary requests (e.g., by tracking and processing only accounts with changes).
    - Ensure the job can process at
