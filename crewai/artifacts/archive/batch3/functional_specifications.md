# Detailed Functional Specifications for the Financial Report API

## 1. Overview
The Financial Report API is designed to support the daily generation of a comprehensive flat file containing ESG ratings for all active accounts within the firm. This API will be integral to the ESG Ratings Batch Job, which leverages the Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API to provide compliance officers, firm administrators, and authorized personnel with up-to-date ESG performance data.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Scheduling and Execution
- **Functionality**: Automatically triggers the batch job at 5:00 AM Central Time daily.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a job scheduler (e.g., cron job) configured to trigger the batch job.
  - Integrate monitoring to ensure that the job starts as scheduled.
  - Implement an alert system to notify the development team if the job fails to start.

### 2.2 Data Retrieval and Processing
- **Functionality**: Retrieves a list of all active accounts and their corresponding ESG ratings.
- **Implementation**:
  - Integrate with the firm's account management system to fetch active accounts.
  - For each account, call the ESG Portfolio Analysis API to retrieve ESG ratings.
  - Implement error handling with a retry mechanism (3 attempts with exponential backoff) for API failures.
  - Log any persistent failures for individual accounts.
  - Use parallel processing for multiple accounts while respecting API rate limits.

### 2.3 Output File Generation
- **Functionality**: Generates a CSV file containing detailed ESG ratings.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a CSV file with the following columns:
    1. Account ID
    2. Account Name
    3. Overall ESG Score
    4. Environmental Score
    5. Social Score
    6. Governance Score
    7. Primary ESG Focus
    8. Primary Focus Score
    9. Analysis Date
    10. Processing Status (Successful/Failed/Partial)
  - Use naming convention: "FirmESGRatings_YYYYMMDD.csv".
  - Ensure decimal values are consistently formatted to two decimal places.
  - For accounts where API calls fail, populate ESG fields with "N/A" and set Processing Status to "Failed".

### 2.4 File Storage and Security
- **Functionality**: Securely stores generated CSV files.
- **Implementation**:
  - Store files in a secure location on the firm's network or cloud storage.
  - Implement encryption for files both in transit and at rest.
  - Set access permissions to restrict access to authorized personnel only.

### 2.5 Logging and Monitoring
- **Functionality**: Provides detailed logs for job execution.
- **Implementation**:
  - Log job start and end times, number of accounts processed, success/failure rates, and any errors encountered.
  - Centralize log storage for easy access and analysis.
  - Integrate logs with the firm's monitoring system to track job health.

### 2.6 Alerting System
- **Functionality**: Notifies appropriate teams during job failures or issues.
- **Implementation**:
  - Implement alerts for:
    1. Job fails to start at the scheduled time.
    2. Job exceeds the 4-hour execution window.
    3. Job encounters a critical error and terminates prematurely.
    4. More than 5% of account API calls fail.
  - Alerts should be sent via email and integrated with the firm's incident management system.
  - Configure alert recipients to include the development team and designated business stakeholders.

### 2.7 Performance Requirements
- **Functionality**: Processes a large number of accounts efficiently.
- **Implementation**:
  - Optimize data handling to minimize memory usage.
  - Track and process only accounts with changes since the last run to reduce unnecessary API calls.
  - Ensure that the batch job can process at least 100,000 accounts within the 4-hour window.

### 2.8 Error Handling and Recovery
- **Functionality**: Handles job interruptions and retries processing.
- **Implementation**:
  - Implement a progress tracking mechanism to allow the job to resume from the last successful point.
  - Create a detailed error log file for accounts that could not be processed successfully.
  - Develop a manual override process to allow re-running the job for specific accounts if necessary.

### 2.9 Reporting and Analytics
- **Functionality**: Generates a daily summary report of the job execution.
- **Implementation**:
  - Prepare a summary report including:
    - Total number of accounts processed.
    - Success rate of API calls.
    - Average ESG scores (Overall, Environmental, Social, Governance).
    - Distribution of primary ESG focus areas.
    - List of accounts with failed processing.
  - Store historical job performance data for trend analysis.

### 2.10 Compliance and Audit
- **Functionality**: Ensures data processing complies with regulations.
- **Implementation**:
  - Implement an audit trail for file access and processing.
  - Retain historical files and logs according to the firm's data retention policy.

## 3. Integration Points
- **Account Management System**: Retrieve active accounts.
- **Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API**: Fetch ESG ratings.
- **Authentication System**: Secure API access.
- **Monitoring and Alerting Systems**: Job health monitoring.
- **Data Warehouse/Business Intelligence Tools**: Potential integration for output data.

## 4. Testing Requirements
- **Functionality**: Validate the robustness and reliability of the API.
- **Implementation**:
  - Develop unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
  - Conduct performance testing to ensure handling of expected account volume.
  - Perform security testing to validate data protection measures.
  - Test various failure scenarios to ensure proper error handling and alerting.

## 5. Documentation
- **Functionality**: Provide comprehensive documentation for the API and its functionalities.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create technical documentation, including system architecture and data flow diagrams.
  - Develop a user guide for understanding output files.
  - Document the alert system, including escalation procedures and troubleshooting steps.

## 6. Training and Support
- **Functionality**: Equip the operations team with knowledge for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Implementation**:
  - Conduct training sessions on job monitoring and basic troubleshooting.
  - Establish a support process for inquiries related to the batch job and its output.

## 7. Success Criteria
- **Functionality**: Ensure reliable and accurate execution of the batch job.
- **Implementation**:
  - The job runs successfully at 5:00 AM Central Time with 99.9% reliability.
  - All active accounts are processed within the 4-hour window.
  - The CSV file produced is accurate and consistent.
  - Alerts are sent promptly and reach the correct recipients.
  - Confirmation from firm administrators that the file meets their ESG performance tracking needs.
  - The system demonstrates scalability with an increasing number of accounts.

## 8. Future Considerations
- **Functionality**: Explore enhancements for the API and job capabilities.
- **Implementation**:
  - Investigate integration with real-time ESG data feeds for more frequent updates.
  - Develop a web-based dashboard for visualizing firm-wide ESG trends.
  - Consider the expansion of metrics or integration with alternative data sources. 

These detailed functional specifications serve as a comprehensive guide for the development and implementation of the Financial Report API, ensuring that all business requirements are effectively translated into technical specifications for successful execution.
