## Technical Design Document: Financial Report API

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the technical design for the Financial Report API, which forms a core component of the ESG Ratings Batch Job. The API is responsible for retrieving ESG ratings from the Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API, processing the data, and generating a comprehensive CSV file for reporting purposes. The design aims to ensure high performance, reliability, security, and compliance with relevant regulations.

**2. System Architecture**

The system architecture comprises the following key components:

* **Account Management System:** This system provides a list of active accounts to be processed.
* **Financial Report API:** This API acts as the central processing unit, orchestrating data retrieval, processing, and file generation.
* **Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API:** This API provides ESG ratings for individual accounts.
* **Data Storage:** The generated CSV files are stored securely in a designated location on the firm's network or cloud storage.
* **Authentication System:** Ensures secure access to both the account management system and the ESG Portfolio Analysis API.
* **Job Scheduler:** Automatically triggers the batch job at 5:00 AM Central Time daily.
* **Monitoring System:** Tracks job performance, health, and alerts.
* **Logging System:** Records detailed information about job execution, including API calls, errors, and processing times.
* **Alerting System:** Sends notifications to the development team and designated business stakeholders in case of failures or critical issues.

**3. Data Flow**

The following diagram illustrates the data flow within the system:

```

**4. API Design**

The Financial Report API will expose the following endpoints:

* **`/accounts`:** Retrieves a list of active accounts from the Account Management System.
* **`/esg_ratings/{account_id}`:** Retrieves ESG ratings for a specific account from the ESG Portfolio Analysis API.
* **`/generate_report`:** Triggers the batch job to generate the comprehensive CSV file.

**5. Data Model**

The following data model will be used for processing ESG ratings:

```
Account:
  - account_id: Unique identifier for the account
  - account_name: Name of the account

ESGData:
  - overall_esg_score: Overall ESG score
  - environmental_score: Environmental score
  - social_score: Social score
  - governance_score: Governance score
  - primary_esg_focus: Primary ESG focus area
  - primary_focus_score: Score for the primary focus area
  - analysis_date: Date of ESG analysis

CSVOutput:
  - account_id: Account ID
  - account_name: Account Name
  - overall_esg_score: Overall ESG Score
  - environmental_score: Environmental Score
  - social_score: Social Score
  - governance_score: Governance Score
  - primary_esg_focus: Primary ESG Focus
  - primary_focus_score: Primary Focus Score
  - analysis_date: Analysis Date
  - processing_status: Successful/Failed/Partial
```

**6. Implementation Details**

* **Language:** Python will be used for API development and batch job implementation.
* **Framework:** Flask will be used as the web framework for the Financial Report API.
* **Database:** A lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) will be used to store job progress and error logs.
* **Job Scheduler:** Cron jobs will be used to schedule the batch job execution.
* **Monitoring System:** Prometheus and Grafana will be used for monitoring job performance and alerts.
* **Logging System:** Logstash will be used for centralized logging and analysis.
* **Alerting System:** PagerDuty will be used for incident management and notifications.

**7. Security Considerations**

* **Authentication:** Secure API access will be enforced using OAuth2 for both the account management system and the ESG Portfolio Analysis API.
* **Data Encryption:** Data will be encrypted in transit using HTTPS and at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
* **Access Control:** Access to the generated CSV files will be restricted to authorized personnel only.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regular vulnerability scans will be conducted to identify and mitigate security risks.

**8. Performance Optimization**

* **Parallel Processing:** The batch job will utilize multithreading to process multiple accounts concurrently, improving performance.
* **API Rate Limiting:** The API calls will be carefully managed to avoid exceeding the rate limits of the ESG Portfolio Analysis API.
* **Caching:** Results from the ESG Portfolio Analysis API will be cached to reduce redundant API calls.
* **Data Compression:** The generated CSV file will be compressed to reduce storage space and improve download speeds.

**9. Error Handling and Recovery**

* **API Error Handling:** The API will handle errors from the ESG Portfolio Analysis API gracefully, implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.
* **Job Interruption:** The batch job will be designed to track its progress and resume from the last successful point in case of interruption.
* **Error Logging:** Detailed error logs will be maintained to track failed API calls and account processing issues.
* **Manual Override:** A manual override process will be available to re-run the job for specific accounts.

**10. Testing and Deployment**

* **Unit Testing:** Unit tests will be written to test individual components of the API and batch job.
* **Integration Testing:** Integration tests will be conducted to ensure that the API and batch job interact correctly with other systems.
* **Performance Testing:** Performance tests will be carried out to ensure the job can handle the expected volume of accounts within the specified time window.
* **Security Testing:** Security testing will be performed to validate data protection measures and identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Deployment:** The API and batch job will be deployed to a secure server environment with appropriate monitoring and logging in place.

**11. Future Considerations**

* **Real-Time Data Integration:** Explore the integration of real-time ESG data feeds to provide more frequent updates.
* **Web-Based Dashboard:** Develop a web-based dashboard for visualizing firm-wide ESG trends and insights.
* **Additional Metrics:** Expand the API to include additional ESG metrics or alternative data sources.

**12. Conclusion**

This technical design document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, implementation, and security considerations for the Financial Report API. The API will play a crucial role in the ESG Ratings Batch Job, enabling efficient and reliable generation of comprehensive ESG reports for compliance officers, firm administrators, and authorized personnel. The design emphasizes performance, scalability, security, and compliance with relevant regulations, ensuring the delivery of accurate and timely ESG data for informed decision-making.
