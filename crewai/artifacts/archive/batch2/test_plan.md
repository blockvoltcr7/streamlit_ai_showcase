# Financial Report API - Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the Financial Report API, focusing on the ESG analysis functionality. The test plan aims to ensure the API meets its functional and non-functional requirements, including accuracy, performance, security, and reliability.

## 2. Test Objectives

The primary objectives of this test plan are:

* **Verify Functionality:** Ensure that the API correctly processes portfolio data, calculates ESG scores, and generates accurate reports.
* **Validate Input Validation:** Confirm that the API properly handles invalid or incomplete input data, preventing unexpected behavior or errors.
* **Test Data Processing:** Verify the accuracy of ESG score calculations and the total market value calculation.
* **Assess Edge Cases:** Evaluate the API's behavior in extreme or unusual scenarios, such as large portfolios, fractional shares, and uneven weight distributions.
* **Ensure Data Consistency:** Confirm that the holdings in the response match those in the request without discrepancies.
* **Evaluate Performance:** Measure the API's response time, throughput, and resource utilization under various load conditions.
* **Assess Security:** Conduct security testing to identify vulnerabilities and ensure the API is protected against potential threats.
* **Confirm Reliability:** Evaluate the API's stability, availability, and error handling capabilities.

## 3. Test Scope

This test plan covers the following aspects of the Financial Report API:

* **ESG Analysis Endpoint:** `/api/portfolio/esg-analysis` (POST)
* **Request Payload:** Validation of input data structure and content.
* **ESG Score Calculation:** Verification of weighted average calculation and individual holding scores.
* **Portfolio Summary:** Validation of total market value and number of holdings.
* **ESG Summary:** Verification of top performers, bottom performers, and areas for improvement.
* **Data Storage:** Testing data persistence and retrieval from the PostgreSQL database.
* **Caching:** Evaluation of Redis caching for ESG data retrieval.
* **Performance:** Measurement of response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
* **Security:** Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

## 4. Test Environment

The test environment will consist of:

* **Test Server:** A dedicated server running the Financial Report API application.
* **Test Database:** A PostgreSQL database instance for storing portfolio and ESG data.
* **Test Cache:** A Redis instance for caching ESG data.
* **Test Clients:** Tools for sending API requests and validating responses.
* **Monitoring Tools:** Prometheus for performance monitoring and logging.

## 5. Test Cases

This section outlines the specific test cases to be executed as part of the test plan.

### 5.1. Functional Tests

**5.1.1. Input Validation Tests**

* **Missing Fields:** Submit requests with missing required fields in the `holdings` array.
* **Invalid Data Types:** Submit requests with incorrect data types for fields like `quantity` or `current_price`.
* **Weight Summation:** Submit requests where the weights of holdings do not sum to exactly 1.0 (100%).
* **Duplicate Tickers:** Submit requests with duplicate `ticker` symbols in the `holdings` array.
* **Invalid Date Format:** Submit requests with an invalid `analysis_date` format.

**5.1.2. Data Processing Tests**

* **ESG Score Calculation:** Verify that the overall ESG score is calculated correctly based on the weighted average of individual scores.
* **Individual Holding Scores:** Confirm that the ESG scores for each holding are retrieved and applied correctly.
* **Total Market Value:** Verify that the `total_market_value` in the response matches the sum of (quantity * current_price) for all holdings.
* **Weight Calculation:** Ensure that the API uses the provided `weight` values in the request and does not recalculate them based on quantity and price.

**5.1.3. ESG Summary Tests**

* **Top Performers:** Verify that the `top_performers` list accurately identifies the holdings with the highest ESG scores.
* **Bottom Performers:** Confirm that the `bottom_performers` list correctly identifies the holdings with the lowest ESG scores.
* **Areas for Improvement:** Verify that the `areas_for_improvement` list provides meaningful insights based on the analysis of ESG scores across different sectors or investment themes.

**5.1.4. Edge Case Tests**

* **Large Holdings:** Submit requests with a large number of holdings (e.g., 1000 or more).
* **Fractional Shares:** Submit requests with fractional share quantities.
* **Extreme Weight Distributions:** Submit requests with one holding having a very high weight (e.g., 99%) and others with very low weights.
* **Zero Weight Holdings:** Submit requests with holdings that have a weight of 0.

**5.1.5. Consistency Tests**

* **Holding Match:** Ensure that the holdings in the response exactly match those in the request, without any missing or extra holdings.
* **Data Integrity:** Verify that the data in the response (ticker, name, weight, ESG scores) is consistent with the data in the request.

### 5.2. Performance Tests

* **Load Testing:** Simulate a high volume of API requests to evaluate the API's performance under load.
* **Stress Testing:** Push the API to its limits to assess its capacity and stability under extreme conditions.
* **Response Time:** Measure the average response time for different request scenarios.
* **Throughput:** Determine the maximum number of requests the API can handle per unit of time.
* **Resource Utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify potential bottlenecks.

### 5.3. Security Tests

* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use automated tools to scan the API for known vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:** Conduct manual security testing to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Verify that the API correctly authenticates and authorizes requests.
* **Data Encryption:** Test the encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Assess the API's vulnerability to XSS attacks.
* **SQL Injection:** Test the API's resistance to SQL injection attacks.

### 5.4. Reliability Tests

* **Availability Testing:** Monitor the API's uptime and availability over a period of time.
* **Error Handling:** Verify that the API gracefully handles errors and provides informative error messages.
* **Recovery Testing:** Test the API's ability to recover from failures or disruptions.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensure that data is consistent and accurate throughout the API's operation.

## 6. Test Execution

* **Test Environment Setup:** Set up the test environment with dedicated servers, database, cache, and tools.
* **Test Case Execution:** Execute the defined test cases systematically, documenting results and any issues encountered.
* **Test Automation:** Utilize automation tools to execute repetitive tests and streamline the testing process.
* **Test Reporting:** Generate detailed test reports summarizing the results, including pass/fail rates, performance metrics, and security findings.

## 7. Test Data

* **Real-World Data:** Utilize real-world portfolio data and ESG scores from external data providers.
* **Synthetic Data:** Generate synthetic data to test specific scenarios or edge cases.
* **Data Masking:** Apply data masking techniques to protect sensitive information during testing.

## 8. Test Results

* **Test Summary:** Summarize the overall test results, including pass/fail rates, performance metrics, and security findings.
* **Issue Tracking:** Document any identified issues, including their severity, description, and proposed solutions.
* **Test Reports:** Generate detailed test reports for each test case, including execution steps, expected results, actual results, and any deviations.

## 9. Conclusion

This comprehensive test plan provides a structured approach to ensure the quality and reliability of the Financial Report API.
