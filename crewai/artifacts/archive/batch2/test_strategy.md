# Financial Report API - Test Strategy

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the high-level test strategy for the Financial Report API, specifically focusing on the ESG analysis functionality. The test strategy aims to provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the API meets its functional, non-functional, and security requirements. It will guide the design and execution of test cases, ensuring thorough validation of the API's capabilities.

## 2. Test Objectives

The primary objectives of the test strategy are:

* **Validate API Functionality:** Ensure the API correctly processes portfolio data, calculates ESG scores, and generates accurate reports, aligning with the defined business logic and requirements.
* **Verify Input Validation:** Confirm that the API effectively handles invalid, incomplete, or malformed input data, preventing unexpected behavior and ensuring data integrity.
* **Assess Data Processing Accuracy:** Verify the accuracy of ESG score calculations, total market value computation, and other data transformations performed by the API.
* **Test Edge Cases and Scenarios:** Evaluate the API's behavior in extreme or unusual situations, such as large portfolios, fractional share quantities, and extreme weight distributions, ensuring robustness and handling of potential outliers.
* **Ensure Data Consistency and Integrity:** Confirm that the data in the API response matches the data in the request without any discrepancies, maintaining data integrity throughout the process.
* **Evaluate API Performance:** Measure the API's response time, throughput, and resource utilization under various load conditions, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.
* **Assess Security Vulnerabilities:** Conduct security testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure the API is protected against known and emerging threats, safeguarding sensitive data and system integrity.
* **Confirm API Reliability:** Evaluate the API's stability, availability, and error handling capabilities, ensuring consistent performance and graceful handling of unexpected events.

## 3. Test Approach

The test strategy will employ a combination of testing techniques, including:

* **Functional Testing:** Focus on validating the core functionality of the API, including data processing, ESG score calculation, and report generation.
* **Input Validation Testing:** Verify the API's ability to handle invalid, incomplete, or malformed input data, ensuring data integrity and preventing unexpected behavior.
* **Data Integrity Testing:** Ensure the consistency and accuracy of data throughout the API's processing, including the handling of ESG scores, portfolio weights, and other relevant data.
* **Performance Testing:** Measure the API's response time, throughput, and resource utilization under various load conditions, assessing its scalability and performance under stress.
* **Security Testing:** Conduct vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to identify potential security weaknesses and ensure the API's resilience against attacks.
* **Regression Testing:** Ensure that new changes or updates to the API do not introduce unintended side effects or regressions in existing functionality.

## 4. Test Levels

The test strategy will encompass multiple levels of testing, including:

* **Unit Testing:** Focus on individual components and modules within the API, ensuring their correctness and isolation.
* **Integration Testing:** Verify the interaction and communication between different API components and modules, ensuring seamless integration.
* **System Testing:** Evaluate the API as a whole, ensuring it meets its functional and non-functional requirements in an end-to-end scenario.
* **Acceptance Testing:** Validate the API against user requirements and specifications, ensuring it meets the expectations of stakeholders and users.

## 5. Test Automation

Test automation will be a critical component of the test strategy, enabling:

* **Increased Test Coverage:** Execute a wider range of test cases, covering various scenarios and edge cases.
* **Reduced Test Execution Time:** Automate repetitive test tasks, significantly reducing the overall testing time.
* **Enhanced Test Consistency:** Ensure consistent test execution and results, minimizing human error and variability.
* **Improved Test Maintainability:** Easily update and modify automated test scripts as the API evolves.

## 6. Test Environment

The test strategy will utilize a dedicated test environment, including:

* **Test Server:** A dedicated server running the Financial Report API application for testing purposes.
* **Test Database:** A PostgreSQL database instance for storing portfolio and ESG data for testing.
* **Test Cache:** A Redis instance for caching ESG data, enabling efficient data retrieval during testing.
* **Test Clients:** Tools for sending API requests and validating responses, facilitating automated testing.
* **Monitoring Tools:** Prometheus for performance monitoring and logging, providing insights into API behavior and resource usage.

## 7. Test Reporting

The test strategy will incorporate comprehensive test reporting, including:

* **Test Summary Reports:** Summarize the overall test results, highlighting pass/fail rates, performance metrics, and security findings.
* **Issue Tracking Reports:** Document any identified issues, including their severity, description, and proposed solutions, enabling effective issue management.
* **Detailed Test Reports:** Provide detailed reports for each test case, including execution steps, expected results, actual results, and any deviations, facilitating analysis and debugging.

## 8. Conclusion

This test strategy provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the quality, reliability, and security of the Financial Report API, specifically focusing on the ESG analysis functionality. By adhering to the outlined objectives, test levels, and automation principles, the test strategy will guide the development of a robust and effective testing process, ultimately contributing to the successful deployment and ongoing maintenance of the API.
