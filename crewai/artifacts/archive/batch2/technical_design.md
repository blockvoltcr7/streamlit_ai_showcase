# Financial Report API - Technical Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical design for the Financial Report API, focusing on the ESG analysis functionality. The API will provide clients with a comprehensive evaluation of the ESG performance of their investment portfolios. 

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. High-Level Architecture

The API will be built using a layered architecture:

* **Presentation Layer:** Handles API requests, performs input validation, and returns responses in JSON format.
* **Business Logic Layer:** Implements the core ESG analysis logic, including data processing, scoring calculations, and summary generation.
* **Data Access Layer:** Interacts with the underlying data storage for portfolio and ESG data.

### 2.2. Technology Stack

* **Server-Side:** Python (FastAPI framework)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for portfolio and ESG data storage)
* **Data Source:** External ESG data provider (e.g., MSCI, Sustainalytics)
* **Caching:** Redis (for caching ESG data)
* **Logging:** Logstash (for centralized logging)
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus (for performance monitoring)

## 3. API Design

### 3.1. Endpoints

* **`/api/portfolio/esg-analysis` (POST)**: Accepts a portfolio definition and returns ESG analysis results.

### 3.2. Request Payload

```json
{
  "api_version": "1.1",
  "endpoint": "/api/portfolio/esg-analysis",
  "method": "POST",
  "request": {
    "portfolio_id": "string",
    "analysis_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "holdings": [
      {
        "ticker": "string",
        "name": "string",
        "quantity": "integer",
        "current_price": "float",
        "weight": "float"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3.3. Response Structure

```json
{
  "status": "string",
  "portfolio_id": "string",
  "analysis_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "portfolio_summary": {
    "total_market_value": "float",
    "number_of_holdings": "integer"
  },
  "esg_analysis": {
    "overall_esg_score": "float",
    "environmental_score": "float",
    "social_score": "float",
    "governance_score": "float",
    "holdings_analysis": [
      {
        "ticker": "string",
        "name": "string",
        "weight": "float",
        "esg_score": "float",
        "environmental_score": "float",
        "social_score": "float",
        "governance_score": "float"
      }
    ]
  },
  "esg_summary": {
    "top_performers": ["string"],
    "bottom_performers": ["string"],
    "areas_for_improvement": ["string"]
  }
}
```

## 4. Data Flow

1. **Request Reception:** The API receives a POST request containing portfolio data.
2. **Input Validation:** The request payload is validated against the defined schema.
3. **Data Retrieval:** ESG scores for each holding are retrieved from the external data provider or the local cache.
4. **ESG Calculation:** The weighted average ESG score for the portfolio is calculated based on the holdings and their ESG scores.
5. **Summary Generation:** The API generates a summary report highlighting top performers, bottom performers, and areas for improvement.
6. **Response Formatting:** The analysis results are formatted into a JSON response.
7. **Response Transmission:** The API sends the JSON response back to the client.

## 5. Technical Details

### 5.1. Input Validation

* **Required Fields:** All required fields in the `holdings` object must be present.
* **Weight Summation:** The weights of the holdings must sum to exactly 1.0 (100%).
* **Duplicate Tickers:** Duplicate `ticker` symbols in the `holdings` array are not allowed.

### 5.2. Data Processing

* **ESG Score Calculation:** The overall ESG score is calculated using the weighted average of the individual scores for E, S, and G.
* **Total Market Value:** The total market value is calculated by summing the product of `quantity` and `current_price` for all holdings.

### 5.3. Edge Case Handling

* **Large Holdings:** The API should be able to handle requests with a large number of holdings (e.g., up to 1000).
* **Fractional Shares:** The API should handle fractional share quantities correctly and not round them.
* **Extreme Weight Distributions:** The API should manage extreme weight distributions effectively (e.g., one holding with 99% weight).

### 5.4. Data Storage

* **Portfolio Data:** The API will store portfolio definitions (including `portfolio_id`, holdings, and analysis dates) in a PostgreSQL database.
* **ESG Data:** ESG scores for individual companies will be retrieved from an external data provider (e.g., MSCI, Sustainalytics) and cached in Redis for faster access.

### 5.5. Caching

* **ESG Data Caching:** ESG scores for individual companies will be cached in Redis to reduce the load on the external data provider and improve performance.

### 5.6. Logging and Monitoring

* **Logging:** The API will utilize Logstash for centralized logging of requests, responses, errors, and other relevant events.
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus will be used to monitor performance metrics like response times, API call rates, and error rates.

### 5.7. Security

* **Authentication and Authorization:** The API will implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to authorized clients.
* **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data, such as portfolio details and ESG scores, will be encrypted in transit and at rest.

## 6. Testing

### 6.1. Test Plan

The testing plan will cover the following aspects:

* **Unit Tests:**  Individual functions and components will be tested to ensure they meet the expected behavior.
* **Integration Tests:**  Testing the interaction between different components of the API.
* **End-to-End Tests:**  Simulating real-world scenarios by sending requests to the API and verifying the responses.
* **Performance Tests:**  Evaluating the API's performance under various load conditions.
* **Security Tests:**  Assessing the API's vulnerability to security threats.

### 6.2. Test Scenarios

* **Input Validation Tests:** Check for missing fields, weight summation, and duplicate tickers.
* **Data Processing Tests:** Validate overall ESG score calculation and total market value.
* **Edge Case Tests:** Assess performance with large holdings, fractional shares, and extreme weight distributions.
* **Consistency Tests:** Ensure response holdings match request holdings without discrepancies.

## 7. Deployment

* **Dockerization:** The API will be packaged as a Docker image for easy deployment and portability.
* **Kubernetes:** The API will be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster for scalability, high availability, and automated deployment.

## 8. Maintenance and Support

* **Versioning:** The API will use semantic versioning to track changes and ensure backward compatibility.
* **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation will be provided for developers and users, covering API specifications, usage instructions, and troubleshooting guides.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Prometheus will be used to monitor API performance and generate alerts for any issues.
* **Feedback Mechanism:** A feedback mechanism will be implemented to collect user feedback and report issues.

## 9. Future Considerations

* **Integration with Other APIs:**  The API could be integrated with other financial data APIs to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
* **Machine Learning Integration:**  Machine learning models could be used to predict future ESG performance or identify emerging trends.
* **Customization:**  The API could be customized to support different ESG data providers or scoring methodologies.
