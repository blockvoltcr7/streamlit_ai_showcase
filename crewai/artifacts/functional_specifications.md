# Functional Specifications Document for Financial Report API

## Overview
The Financial Report API is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores of a portfolio. This document outlines the detailed specifications for the request payload and response structure, input validation, data processing, edge case handling, and consistency checks. 

## API Specifications

### API Endpoint
- **Base URL**: `/api/portfolio/esg-analysis`
- **Method**: `POST`

### Request Payload Structure

The request payload must adhere to the following structure:

```json
{
  "api_version": "1.1",
  "endpoint": "/api/portfolio/esg-analysis",
  "method": "POST",
  "request": {
    "portfolio_id": "string",
    "analysis_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "holdings": [
      {
        "ticker": "string",
        "name": "string",
        "quantity": "integer",
        "current_price": "float",
        "weight": "float"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Fields Description
- `api_version`: The version of the API being used.
- `endpoint`: The API endpoint being accessed.
- `method`: The HTTP method of the request.
- `portfolio_id`: Unique identifier for the portfolio being analyzed.
- `analysis_date`: Date of the analysis in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- `holdings`: An array containing holding objects, each representing a stock in the portfolio.
  - `ticker`: The stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL).
  - `name`: The full name of the company (e.g., Apple Inc.).
  - `quantity`: The number of shares held.
  - `current_price`: The current market price of the stock.
  - `weight`: The proportion of this holding in the portfolio expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.25 for 25%).

### Expected Response Structure

The API response will return a structured JSON object:

```json
{
  "status": "string",
  "portfolio_id": "string",
  "analysis_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "portfolio_summary": {
    "total_market_value": "float",
    "number_of_holdings": "integer"
  },
  "esg_analysis": {
    "overall_esg_score": "float",
    "environmental_score": "float",
    "social_score": "float",
    "governance_score": "float",
    "holdings_analysis": [
      {
        "ticker": "string",
        "name": "string",
        "weight": "float",
        "esg_score": "float",
        "environmental_score": "float",
        "social_score": "float",
        "governance_score": "float"
      }
    ]
  },
  "esg_summary": {
    "top_performers": ["string"],
    "bottom_performers": ["string"],
    "areas_for_improvement": ["string"]
  }
}
```

#### Fields Description
- `status`: Indicates the success or failure of the request.
- `portfolio_id`: The ID of the portfolio analyzed.
- `analysis_date`: The date the analysis was performed.
- `portfolio_summary`: Summary of the portfolio.
  - `total_market_value`: Total market value of the portfolio.
  - `number_of_holdings`: The total number of holdings in the portfolio.
- `esg_analysis`: Detailed ESG analysis of the portfolio.
  - `overall_esg_score`: The overall ESG score of the portfolio.
  - `environmental_score`: ESG score for the environmental aspect.
  - `social_score`: ESG score for the social aspect.
  - `governance_score`: ESG score for the governance aspect.
  - `holdings_analysis`: Array of detailed scores for each holding.
- `esg_summary`: Summary of ESG performance.
  - `top_performers`: List of holdings with the highest ESG scores.
  - `bottom_performers`: List of holdings with the lowest ESG scores.
  - `areas_for_improvement`: Recommendations for improving ESG practices.

### Input Validation

The API must validate the following conditions:
- All required fields in the `holdings` object must be present.
- The weights of the holdings must sum to exactly 1.0 (100%).
- Duplicate `ticker` symbols in the `holdings` array must not be allowed.

### Data Processing

The following processing must be applied:
- Calculate the overall ESG score using the weighted average of the individual scores for E, S, and G.
- Calculate the total market value by summing the product of `quantity` and `current_price` for all holdings.

### Edge Case Handling

The API must handle the following edge cases:
- Support requests with a large number of holdings (e.g., up to 1000).
- Handle fractional share quantities correctly and not round them.
- Manage extreme weight distributions effectively (e.g., one holding with 99% weight).

### Consistency Checks

The API must ensure:
- The holdings in the response must match those in the request.
- No additional holdings should appear in the response that were not included in the request.

### Testing Plan

The testing plan should include:
- **Input Validation Tests**: Check for missing fields, weight summation, and duplicate tickers.
- **Data Processing Tests**: Validate overall ESG score calculation and total market value.
- **Edge Case Tests**: Assess performance with large holdings, fractional shares, and extreme weight distributions.
- **Consistency Tests**: Ensure response holdings match request holdings without discrepancies.

### Performance Monitoring

The API must implement performance monitoring that:
- Logs response times for each request.
- Alerts the development team if response times exceed predefined thresholds.

### User Feedback Mechanism

A user feedback mechanism must be integrated that:
- Allows clients to submit feedback or report issues easily.
- Conducts regular reviews to identify areas for improvement based on user feedback.
