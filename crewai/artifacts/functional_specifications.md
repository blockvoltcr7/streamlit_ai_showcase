# Functional Specifications for the Financial Report API

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the functional specifications for the Financial Report API that will support the daily batch job generating ESG ratings for all accounts within the firm. The API will facilitate the retrieval and processing of ESG ratings, ensuring compliance and efficient reporting.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Scheduling and Execution
- **Functionality**: The batch job must be scheduled to run automatically every day at 5:00 AM Central Time.
- **Implementation**:
  - Utilize a cron job or similar scheduling mechanism.
  - Ensure that the job is configured to complete within a 4-hour execution window.
  - If not completed by 9:00 AM Central Time, the job should terminate and send an alert.

### 2.2 Data Retrieval and Processing
- **Functionality**: Retrieve a comprehensive list of active accounts and their corresponding ESG ratings.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Account Retrieval**: 
    - Integrate with the firm's account management system using a RESTful API to fetch active accounts.
    - Ensure that the API call returns a complete, paginated list of accounts.
  - **ESG Ratings Retrieval**: 
    - For each account, invoke the Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API to obtain the latest ESG ratings.
    - Implement a retry mechanism for API calls with up to 3 attempts and exponential backoff.
    - Log failures for accounts that cannot be processed after retries.
  - **Parallel Processing**: 
    - Use multithreading to process multiple API calls simultaneously while adhering to rate limits.

### 2.3 Output File Generation
- **Functionality**: Generate a CSV file containing ESG ratings and related information.
- **Implementation**:
  - The CSV file must include the following columns:
    - Account ID
    - Account Name
    - Overall ESG Score
    - Environmental Score
    - Social Score
    - Governance Score
    - Primary ESG Focus
    - Primary Focus Score
    - Analysis Date
    - Processing Status (Successful/Failed/Partial)
  - The file should include a header row with column names.
  - Use the naming convention: `FirmESGRatings_YYYYMMDD.csv`.
  - Ensure decimal values are formatted to two decimal places.
  - Populate ESG fields with "N/A" for accounts with failed API calls and mark their Processing Status as "Failed".

### 2.4 File Storage and Security
- **Functionality**: Securely store the generated CSV file.
- **Implementation**:
  - Store the file in a designated secure location (either on the firm’s network or cloud storage).
  - Implement encryption for the file in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using AES-256).
  - Set access permissions to restrict file access to authorized personnel only.

### 2.5 Logging and Monitoring
- **Functionality**: Provide comprehensive logging of the batch job execution.
- **Implementation**:
  - Log the following details:
    - Job start and end times
    - Number of accounts processed
    - Success/Failure counts of API calls
    - Detailed error messages and stack traces for any exceptions
  - Store logs in a centralized logging system for analysis.
  - Integrate with the firm’s monitoring system to track job health and performance.

### 2.6 Alerting System
- **Functionality**: Notify relevant stakeholders of job failures and performance issues.
- **Implementation**:
  - Send alerts in the following scenarios:
    - Job fails to start at the scheduled time.
    - Job execution exceeds the 4-hour window.
    - The job encounters critical errors leading to premature termination.
    - More than 5% of API calls fail.
  - Alerts should be sent via email and integrated with the firm's incident management system (e.g., PagerDuty).

### 2.7 Performance Requirements
- **Functionality**: Ensure the job can handle a high volume of accounts efficiently.
- **Implementation**:
  - The system must process at least 100,000 accounts within the 4-hour window.
  - Optimize API calls to track changes since the last run to minimize unnecessary requests.

### 2.8 Error Handling and Recovery
- **Functionality**: Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- **Implementation**:
  - Track job progress to allow resumption from the last successful point in case of interruption.
  - Create an error log file detailing any accounts that could not be processed.
  - Allow manual overrides for specific accounts that require reprocessing.

### 2.9 Reporting and Analytics
- **Functionality**: Generate a daily summary report of the batch job outcomes.
- **Implementation**:
  - The report should include metrics such as:
    - Total accounts processed
    - Success rate
    - Average ESG scores (Overall, Environmental, Social, Governance)
    - Distribution of primary ESG focus areas
    - List of accounts with processing failures
  - Store historical job performance data for trend analysis.

### 2.10 Compliance and Audit
- **Functionality**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and maintain an audit trail.
- **Implementation**:
  - Implement measures to comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations.
  - Create an audit trail for access to generated files.
  - Retain historical files and logs according to the firm’s data retention policy.

## 3. Integration Points
- **Account Management System**: For retrieving a list of active accounts.
- **Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API**: For fetching ESG ratings.
- **Authentication System**: For secure API access.
- **Monitoring and Alerting Systems**: For tracking job health and notifications.
- **Data Warehouse/Business Intelligence Tools**: For potential integration of the output file.

## 4. Testing Requirements
- Develop a comprehensive suite of tests, including:
  - Unit tests for individual components.
  - Integration tests for interactions between systems.
  - End-to-end tests for the entire flow from account retrieval to file generation.
  - Performance testing to validate that the job can handle the expected volume.
  - Security testing to verify data protection measures.
  - Tests for various failure scenarios to ensure proper error handling.

## 5. Documentation
- Provide detailed technical documentation, including:
  - System architecture and data flow diagrams.
  - API integration details.
  - User guides for business users to interpret the output file.
  - Documentation for the alert system, including escalation procedures.

## 6. Training and Support
- Conduct training sessions for the operations team on monitoring the job and troubleshooting.
- Establish a support process for inquiries related to the batch job and its output.

## 7. Success Criteria
- The batch job runs successfully at 5:00 AM Central Time every day with a reliability of 99.9%.
- All active accounts are processed within the 4-hour window.
- The generated CSV file is accurate and adheres to the specified format.
- Alerts are sent promptly and to the correct recipients in case of failures or issues.
- The output meets the needs of firm administrators for tracking ESG performance.
- The system demonstrates scalability as the number of accounts increases.

## 8. Future Considerations
- Explore integration with real-time ESG data feeds for more frequent updates.
- Develop a web-based dashboard for visualizing firm-wide ESG trends.
- Consider expanding to include additional ESG metrics or alternative data sources.
