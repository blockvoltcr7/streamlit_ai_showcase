# Functional Specifications Document for ESG Ratings Batch Job API

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the functional specifications for the ESG Ratings Batch Job API, designed to generate a daily CSV file containing ESG ratings for all active accounts within the firm. The process aims to support compliance officers and firm administrators by providing timely and comprehensive ESG performance data.

## 2. Objectives
- To ensure a daily automated process that generates and stores ESG ratings for all active accounts.
- To provide timely and accurate data for compliance and auditing purposes.

## 3. Detailed Functional Specifications

### 3.1 Scheduling and Execution
- **Specification**: The batch job must run automatically every day at 5:00 AM Central Time.
- **Execution Time Limit**: The job must complete within a 4-hour window.
- **Failure Handling**: If the job has not completed by 9:00 AM Central Time, it should be terminated, and an alert is sent to the development team.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement cron job or scheduling service to trigger execution.
  - Monitor execution time and implement termination logic.
  - Configure alerting for job failures.

### 3.2 Data Retrieval and Processing
- **Specification**: The API must retrieve a list of all active accounts and fetch ESG ratings for each account.
- **Error Handling**: Implement a retry mechanism for API calls with exponential backoff for transient errors.
- **Concurrency**: Utilize parallel processing to handle multiple account requests simultaneously without exceeding API rate limits.
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate with the firm's account management system to retrieve active accounts.
  - Call the Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API for each account.
  - Implement logging for errors and exceptions.

### 3.3 Output File Generation
- **Specification**: Generate a CSV file with specified columns including Account ID, Account Name, ESG scores, and Processing Status.
- **File Naming Convention**: Use "FirmESGRatings_YYYYMMDD.csv".
- **Data Formatting**: Ensure decimal values are formatted to two decimal places. For failed API calls, populate fields with "N/A" and set Processing Status to "Failed".
- **Tasks**:
  - Create CSV with a header row and required fields.
  - Implement logic to handle formatting and include error handling in the output.

### 3.4 File Storage and Security
- **Specification**: The generated file must be securely stored and encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Set permissions to restrict access to authorized personnel only.
- **Tasks**:
  - Store the file in a designated secure location determined by the firm.
  - Implement encryption protocols for file storage and transfer.

### 3.5 Logging and Monitoring
- **Specification**: Comprehensive logging must capture job execution details, including start and end times, processing statistics, and errors.
- **Centralized Logging**: Store logs in a centralized logging system for access and analysis.
- **Tasks**:
  - Configure logging framework to capture relevant job metrics.
  - Integrate with monitoring tools to report job health.

### 3.6 Alerting System
- **Specification**: Implement an alerting mechanism to notify stakeholders of job failures, critical errors, or significant API call failures.
- **Notification Channels**: Use email and integrate with incident management systems (e.g., PagerDuty).
- **Tasks**:
  - Define alerting criteria based on job execution outcomes.
  - Configure alert recipients and messages.

### 3.7 Performance Requirements
- **Specification**: The batch job must process at least 100,000 accounts within the 4-hour window.
- **Efficiency**: Implement data handling techniques to minimize memory usage and optimize API calls.
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct performance testing to validate processing capabilities.
  - Monitor resource usage during execution.

### 3.8 Error Handling and Recovery
- **Specification**: Implement a progress tracking mechanism to allow job resumption from the last successful state.
- **Error Logging**: Maintain a separate error log file for accounts that failed processing.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop recovery procedures to handle job interruptions.
  - Create a manual override process for re-running specific accounts.

### 3.9 Reporting and Analytics
- **Specification**: Generate a daily summary report detailing account processing statistics and success rates.
- **Historical Data**: Store job performance data for further analysis.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define report format and metrics to be included.
  - Schedule report generation after each job execution.

### 3.10 Compliance and Audit
- **Specification**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and maintain an audit trail for file access.
- **Retention Policy**: Retain historical files and logs as per the firmâ€™s data retention policy.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement access logs and audit trails for generated files.
  - Review retention requirements and configure storage policies.

## 4. Integration Points
- **Account Management System**: For retrieving active accounts.
- **ESG Portfolio Analysis API**: For fetching ratings.
- **Authentication System**: For secure API access.
- **Monitoring and Alerting Systems**: For job performance tracking.

## 5. Testing Requirements
- **Specification**: Develop and execute a comprehensive test suite including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Performance Testing**: Validate the job can handle the expected volume of accounts effectively.
- **Security Testing**: Ensure data protection measures are effective.
- **Failure Scenario Testing**: Verify error handling and alerting functionalities.

## 6. Documentation
- **Technical Documentation**: Include system architecture, data flow diagrams, and integration details.
- **User Guide**: Provide instructions for business users on file interpretation.
- **Alert System Documentation**: Outline escalation procedures and troubleshooting steps.

## 7. Training and Support
- **Specification**: Conduct training sessions for the operations team.
- **Support Process**: Establish a support mechanism for inquiries related to the batch job.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop training materials and host sessions.
  - Document support procedures for ongoing assistance.

## 8. Success Criteria
- The batch job runs successfully at 5:00 AM Central Time every day with 99.9% reliability.
- All active accounts are processed within the 4-hour window.
- The produced CSV file is accurate and formatted correctly.
- Alerts are sent promptly in case of issues.
- User feedback confirms the file meets requirements.

## 9. Future Considerations
