# Financial Report API Test Plan - QA Feedback

## Overall Impression

The test plan provides a good starting point for testing the Financial Report API. It covers a wide range of testing aspects, including functional, performance, security, and integration testing. However, there are some areas for improvement and clarification to ensure comprehensive test coverage and alignment with the original requirements.

## Improvements and Clarifications

**1. Test Case Specificity:**

- **5.1.1. Account Retrieval and Processing:**
    - **Test Case 1:**  Consider adding a test case to verify that the API handles inactive accounts appropriately (e.g., excludes them from the report or logs them with a specific status).
    - **Test Case 2:**  Include specific scenarios for authentication and authorization failures.
    - **Test Case 3:**  Add test cases to validate the handling of different data formats and data types returned by the ESG API.
    - **Test Case 4:**  Expand the validation of the CSV file to include data integrity checks (e.g., verifying data consistency across different columns, checking for duplicates, etc.).
    - **Test Case 5:**  Include test cases to validate the handling of different types of API errors (e.g., connection errors, timeout errors, authentication errors, etc.).
    - **Test Case 6:**  Specify the logging format and the expected data elements in the logs.
    - **Test Case 7:**  Add test cases to verify the alert content and recipient list for different failure scenarios.

**2. Test Data and Environment:**

- **Test Data:**  Provide detailed information about the test data, including the size, variety, and how it represents real-world data.
- **Test Systems:**  Specify the versions of the software and dependencies used in the test environment.
- **Test Tools:**  Include specific versions or configurations of the test tools.

**3. Performance Testing:**

- **Test Case 8:**  Define the load profile for the performance testing, including the number of concurrent users, request frequency, and data volume.
- **Test Case 9:**  Set performance thresholds for memory usage and CPU utilization.

**4. Security Testing:**

- **Test Case 11:**  Specify the encryption algorithms used for data in transit and at rest.
- **Test Case 12:**  Include test cases to validate the authentication process with different user roles and permissions.

**5. Integration Testing:**

- **Test Case 14:**  Specify the methods used to verify the API's integration with the AMS.
- **Test Case 15:**  Include test cases to validate the handling of different API responses from the ESG API.
- **Test Case 16:**  Specify the types of alerts and the expected behavior of the monitoring and alerting system.

**6. Test Automation:**

- **Test Automation:**  Provide details about the tools and frameworks used for test automation.
- **Test Cases:**  Specify which test cases will be automated and which will be manual.

**7. Test Success Criteria:**

- **Test Success Criteria:**  Provide specific acceptance criteria for each test case, including performance metrics, security standards, and integration requirements.

## Questions for the Business

- **Data Retention Policy:**  What is the firm's data retention policy for the generated ESG rating files and logs?
- **Alert Thresholds:**  What are the acceptable thresholds for API call failures and performance issues that trigger alerts?
- **Data Security Requirements:**  What are the specific data security requirements for the ESG ratings and the generated CSV file?
- **User Roles and Permissions:**  What user roles and permissions are required for accessing the generated CSV file?
- **Integration Points:**  Are there any other systems or applications that need to be integrated with the Financial Report API?

## Risks and Missing Requirements

- **Data Validation:**  The test plan should include test cases to validate the accuracy and consistency of the data retrieved from the ESG API.
- **API Rate Limiting:**  Consider test cases to verify the API's handling of API rate limits imposed by the ESG API.
- **Scalability:**  The test plan should include performance testing to evaluate the API's scalability as the number of accounts grows.
- **Data Security:**  The test plan should include security testing to validate the API's data security measures, including encryption, access control, and vulnerability scanning.

## Alignment with Original Requirements

The test plan generally aligns with the original requirements outlined in the ESG Ratings Batch Job Requirement Document. However, some specific requirements need further clarification or testing:

- **3.2 Data Retrieval and Processing:**  The test plan should include test cases to verify the API's handling of API errors and timeouts, including the retry mechanism with exponential backoff.
- **3.3 Output File Generation:**  The test plan should include test cases to validate the format and content of the generated CSV file, including data accuracy, consistency, and compliance with the specified format.
- **3.4 File Storage and Security:**  The test plan should include security testing to validate the API's data protection measures, including encryption, access control, and secure storage.
- **3.5 Logging and Monitoring:**  The test plan should include test cases to verify the API's logging and monitoring capabilities, ensuring that all relevant events and errors are logged and monitored effectively.
- **3.6 Alerting System:**  The test plan should include test cases to validate the API's alerting system, ensuring that alerts are sent promptly and to the correct recipients in case of failures or critical issues.

## Conclusion

By addressing the feedback and questions outlined in this document, the QA team can enhance the test plan and ensure comprehensive testing of the Financial Report API, ultimately delivering a high-quality and reliable solution for generating ESG ratings reports.
