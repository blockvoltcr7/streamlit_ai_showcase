# Product Backlog for ESG Analysis API

## Epic: ESG Analysis API Development

### User Story 1: Request Payload Structure
- **As a** client developer  
- **I want** to send a request payload containing holdings data  
- **So that** I can receive a comprehensive ESG analysis for my portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The request must include an `api_version`, `endpoint`, `method`, and `request` object.
- The `request` object must contain `portfolio_id`, `analysis_date`, and a `holdings` array.
- Each holding in the `holdings` array must include:
  - `ticker` (string)
  - `name` (string)
  - `quantity` (integer)
  - `current_price` (float)
  - `weight` (float)

---

### User Story 2: Response Structure
- **As a** client developer  
- **I want** to receive a structured response from the API  
- **So that** I can easily analyze the ESG scores of my portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The response must include:
  - `status` (string)
  - `portfolio_id` (string)
  - `analysis_date` (string)
  - `portfolio_summary` object containing:
    - `total_market_value` (float)
    - `number_of_holdings` (integer)
  - `esg_analysis` object containing:
    - `overall_esg_score` (float)
    - `environmental_score` (float)
    - `social_score` (float)
    - `governance_score` (float)
    - `holdings_analysis` array with detailed scores for each holding.
  - `esg_summary` object summarizing:
    - `top_performers` (array of strings)
    - `bottom_performers` (array of strings)
    - `areas_for_improvement` (array of strings)

### User Story 3: Input Validation
- **As a** client developer  
- **I want** to ensure that the API handles invalid input correctly  
- **So that** I can prevent errors in the ESG analysis process.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The API must validate that all required fields in the holdings are present.
- The API must handle cases where the `holdings` weight does not sum to 100%.
- The API must reject requests with duplicate `ticker` symbols.

---

### User Story 4: Data Processing
- **As a** client developer  
- **I want** the API to process the provided holdings data correctly  
- **So that** I can trust the ESG analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The API must calculate the overall ESG score using the provided weights.
- The API must ensure the total market value in the response matches the sum of `quantity * current_price` for all holdings.

---

### User Story 5: Edge Case Handling
- **As a** client developer  
- **I want** the API to handle edge cases gracefully  
- **So that** it can be robust under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The API must process requests with a large number of holdings without performance degradation.
- The API must handle fractional share quantities appropriately.
- The API must manage extreme weight distributions in the holdings.

---

### User Story 6: Consistency Checks
- **As a** client developer  
- **I want** to ensure the response data is consistent with the input data  
- **So that** I can verify the accuracy of the ESG analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The holdings in the response must match those in the request without discrepancies.
- The API must not include any additional holdings in the response that were not present in the request.

---

### User Story 7: API Documentation
- **As a** product owner  
- **I want** comprehensive documentation for the API  
- **So that** developers can easily integrate and use the ESG Analysis API.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The documentation must cover:
  - API endpoint details
  - Request and response structure examples
  - Error handling and input validation guidelines
  - Use cases and examples for various client scenarios.

---

### User Story 8: Testing Plan
- **As a** QA engineer  
- **I want** a detailed testing plan for the API  
- **So that** I can ensure all functionalities are working as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The testing plan must include:
  - Input validation tests
  - Data processing tests
  - Edge case tests
  - Consistency tests
- Each test case must define expected outcomes and scenarios.

---

### User Story 9: Performance Monitoring
- **As a** product owner  
- **I want** to implement performance monitoring for the API  
- **So that** we can track response times and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The API must log response times for each request.
- The monitoring system must alert the team if response times exceed a defined threshold.

---

### User Story 10: User Feedback Mechanism
- **As a** product owner  
- **I want** to collect user feedback on the API  
- **So that** we can continuously improve the product.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- A feedback mechanism must be integrated into the API documentation.
- Users must be able to submit feedback or report issues easily.
- Regular reviews of feedback must be conducted to identify areas for improvement.
