With a new God of War game on the horizon, a mellowed out Kratos working on his "Dad of the Year" award, and a shift from Greek to Norse mythology, it's important to take a look back at the journey of Kratos and see just how far he's come. Here's Kratos' story in seven minutes, with spoilers ahead.

Kratos, a Spartan warrior who later learns he is a demigod born of Zeus and a mortal woman named Callisto, becomes a servant to the God of War, Ares, after calling out for help in battle. However, he is tricked into killing his own wife and child in a fit of rage, leading to a series of events where he attempts to break free from his blood oath with Ares.

Kratos is captured by the three Furies, who mess with his mind and give him amnesia until he is led to the Oracle Delphi by Orkos to learn the truth. In order to break free from his madness, Kratos must kill those who keep his bond, including Ares and the Furies. He then makes it his goal to remove the memories of murdering his family.

Kratos faces off against Zeus and eventually kills him using the power of hope hidden inside Pandora's box. The world is left in chaos, and Kratos' journey continues as he becomes involved in Norse mythology and takes on the role of a seemingly solid dad to a child named Atreus.

The story of Kratos is one of revenge, redemption, and the struggle to overcome his past. His adventures are far from over, and the next chapter in the God of War series will surely bring more challenges and battles for the God of War.
