# ESG Ratings Batch Job Requirement Document

## 1. Overview
Develop a daily batch job that generates a comprehensive flat file containing ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) ratings for all accounts within the firm. This job will leverage the Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API to provide a firm-wide view of ESG performance.

## 2. Objective
To provide compliance officers, firm administrators, and other authorized personnel with a daily updated, comprehensive overview of the firm's ESG performance across all accounts.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Scheduling and Execution
- The batch job must run automatically every day at 5:00 AM Central Time.
- The job should be designed to complete within a 4-hour window to ensure data is available at the start of the business day.
- If the job has not completed by 9:00 AM Central Time, it should be terminated, and an alert should be sent to the development team.

### 3.2 Data Retrieval and Processing
- Query the firm's account management system to retrieve a list of all active accounts.
- For each account:
  - Call the ESG Portfolio Analysis API to retrieve the latest ESG ratings.
  - Handle any API errors or timeouts gracefully, implementing a retry mechanism (3 attempts with exponential backoff).
  - Log any persistent failures for individual accounts.
- Implement parallel processing to handle multiple accounts simultaneously, respecting API rate limits.

### 3.3 Output File Generation
- Produce a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file with the following columns:
  1. Account ID
  2. Account Name
  3. Overall ESG Score
  4. Environmental Score
  5. Social Score
  6. Governance Score
  7. Primary ESG Focus
  8. Primary Focus Score
  9. Analysis Date
  10. Processing Status (Successful/Failed/Partial)
- Include a header row in the CSV file with column names.
- Use the naming convention: "FirmESGRatings_YYYYMMDD.csv"
- Ensure that decimal values are formatted consistently (e.g., to two decimal places).
- For any accounts where API calls failed, populate the ESG fields with "N/A" and set the Processing Status to "Failed".

### 3.4 File Storage and Security
- Store the generated file in a designated secure location on the firm's network or cloud storage.
- Implement encryption for the file both in transit and at rest.
- Set appropriate access permissions to ensure only authorized personnel can access the file.

### 3.5 Logging and Monitoring
- Implement comprehensive logging throughout the job execution:
  - Job start and end times
  - Number of accounts processed
  - Number of successful/failed/partial API calls
  - Any errors or exceptions encountered
- Store logs in a centralized logging system for easy access and analysis.
- Integrate with the firm's monitoring system to track job performance and health.

### 3.6 Alerting System
- Implement an alerting system that sends notifications in the following scenarios:
  1. Job fails to start at the scheduled time
  2. Job exceeds the 4-hour execution window
  3. Job encounters a critical error and terminates prematurely
  4. More than 5% of account API calls fail
- Alerts should be sent via email and integrated with the firm's incident management system (e.g., PagerDuty).
- Alert recipients should include the development team and designated business stakeholders.

### 3.7 Performance Requirements
- The job must be capable of processing at least 100,000 accounts within the 4-hour window.
- Implement efficient data handling to minimize memory usage, considering potential growth in the number of accounts.
- Optimize API calls to minimize unnecessary requests (e.g., by tracking and processing only accounts with changes since the last run).

### 3.8 Error Handling and Recovery
- Implement a mechanism to track progress, allowing the job to resume from the last successful point in case of interruption.
- Create a separate error log file detailing any accounts that could not be processed successfully.
- Develop a manual override process to re-run the job for specific accounts if needed.

### 3.9 Reporting and Analytics
- Generate a daily summary report including:
  - Total number of accounts processed
  - Success rate
  - Average ESG scores (Overall, E, S, G)
  - Distribution of primary ESG focus areas
  - List of accounts with failed processing
- Store historical job performance data for trend analysis.

### 3.10 Compliance and Audit
- Ensure all data processing complies with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Implement an audit trail to track access to the generated files.
- Retain historical files and logs for a period specified by the firm's data retention policy.

## 4. Integration Points
- Firm's Account Management System: To retrieve the list of active accounts.
- Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API: To fetch ESG ratings for each account.
- Firm's Authentication System: For secure API access.
- Monitoring and Alerting Systems: For job health monitoring and notifications.
- Data Warehouse or Business Intelligence Tools: For potential integration of the output file.

## 5. Testing Requirements
- Develop a comprehensive test suite including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- Conduct performance testing to ensure the job can handle the expected volume of accounts.
- Perform security testing to validate data protection measures.
- Test various failure scenarios to ensure proper error handling and alerting.

## 6. Documentation
- Provide detailed technical documentation including system architecture, data flow diagrams, and API integration details.
- Create a user guide for business users explaining how to interpret the output file.
- Document the alert system, including escalation procedures and troubleshooting steps.

## 7. Training and Support
- Conduct training sessions for the operations team on job monitoring and basic troubleshooting.
- Establish a support process for handling inquiries related to the batch job and its output.

## 8. Success Criteria
- The batch job runs successfully at 5:00 AM Central Time every day with 99.9% reliability.
- All active accounts are processed within the 4-hour window.
- The produced CSV file is accurate, consistent with individual API calls, and adheres to the specified format.
- Alerts are sent promptly and to the correct recipients in case of job failures or critical issues.
- Firm administrators confirm that the file meets their needs for firm-wide ESG performance tracking.
- The system demonstrates the ability to scale as the number of accounts grows.

## 9. Future Considerations
- Potential integration with real-time ESG data feeds for more frequent updates.
- Development of a web-based dashboard for visualizing firm-wide ESG trends.
- Expansion to include additional ESG metrics or alternative data sources.
