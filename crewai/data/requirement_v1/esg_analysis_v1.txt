Tailoring ESG requirements based on specific portfolio objectives or investor preferences is becoming increasingly common and valuable in the investment world. 
Let's explore how we could incorporate this into our API.

Explanation of the changes and new features:

1. ESG Objective in Request:
   - Added an `esg_objective` object in the request, allowing clients to specify their focus (environmental, social, or governance), minimum acceptable score, and target portfolio score.

2. Focused Analysis:
   - The response now focuses on the environmental scores, aligning with the specified objective.

3. Objective Achievement:
   - Includes a `target_achievement` percentage, showing how close the portfolio is to the desired target score.

4. Holding-Level Alignment:
   - Each holding now has an `objective_alignment` rating, indicating how well it aligns with the environmental focus.

5. Recommendations:
   - Provides actionable recommendations based on the environmental objective, suggesting increases, monitoring, or further research.

6. Objective Summary:
   - Gives an overview of how well the portfolio meets the specified ESG objective, including the number of holdings above/below the minimum score.

Benefits of this approach:

1. Customization: Allows for tailored analysis based on specific ESG goals or investor mandates.

2. Focused Improvement: Helps identify which holdings are contributing to or detracting from the ESG objective.

3. Actionable Insights: Provides clear recommendations for improving alignment with the ESG objective.

4. Flexibility: Can be easily adapted for different ESG focuses (environmental, social, or governance) or even combined objectives.

5. Compliance: Helps ensure the portfolio meets specific ESG criteria, which could be crucial for certain investors or funds with strict mandates.

6. Engagement: Provides data that can be used to engage with companies in the portfolio about improving their environmental practices.

This enhanced API would be particularly useful for:

- Thematic ESG funds (e.g., clean energy funds, low-carbon funds)
- Institutional investors with specific ESG mandates
- Wealth managers creating customized portfolios for environmentally conscious clients
- Companies looking to align their investment portfolio with their corporate sustainability goals

By incorporating ESG objectives into the portfolio analysis, this API provides a more targeted and actionable approach to ESG investing, allowing clients to not just measure ESG performance, but actively work towards specific sustainability goals through their investment decisions.

Certainly! I'll create a Business Requirements Document (BRD) in the form of a Jira epic for our ESG Objective-Based Portfolio Analysis API. This epic will outline the key features, user stories, and acceptance criteria for the project.

Certainly. I'll update the Jira EPIC BRD to reflect the changes we've discussed, particularly focusing on the multi-objective ESG analysis and the streamlined request/response structure. Here's the updated version:





# Epic: Implement Multi-Objective ESG Portfolio Analysis API

## Epic Description
Develop an API that enables wealth management firms and individual investors to analyze their investment portfolios based on multiple, customizable Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives simultaneously. This API will allow users to assess how well their portfolios align with specific ESG goals across all three dimensions, with emphasis on a primary focus area, and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Business Value
- Enable clients to align their investment strategies with specific ESG mandates or preferences across multiple ESG dimensions
- Provide a competitive edge in the growing sustainable investment market by offering more nuanced ESG analysis
- Facilitate compliance with evolving ESG regulations and reporting requirements
- Enhance client satisfaction by offering personalized, multi-objective ESG analysis

## User Stories

Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can specify objectives for all three ESG dimensions (environmental, social, and governance)
- Users can set a primary ESG focus
- Users can set minimum acceptable ESG scores and target scores for each dimension

### US2: Portfolio Data Input

- The API validates that the sum of weights equals 100%
- The API handles a minimum of 100 holdings per request

### US3: Multi-Dimensional ESG Score Calculation
As a financial analyst, I want the API to calculate ESG scores for individual holdings and the overall portfolio across all three ESG dimensions so that I can understand the comprehensive ESG performance of my investments.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The API retrieves up-to-date ESG scores for each holding from a reliable data provider
- The API calculates individual E, S, and G scores as well as an overall ESG score for the portfolio
- The API weights the primary focus more heavily in the overall score calculation

### US4: Multi-Objective Alignment Analysis
As a portfolio manager, I want to see how well my portfolio aligns with all specified ESG objectives, with emphasis on the primary focus, so that I can report comprehensive information to my clients.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The API calculates alignment for each ESG dimension
- The API provides a summary of how many holdings meet or exceed the minimum specified scores for each dimension
- The API highlights performance in the primary focus area

### US5: Actionable Recommendations
As an investor, I want to receive actionable recommendations based on the multi-dimensional ESG analysis so that I can improve my portfolio's alignment with my ESG objectives.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The API provides at least three specific recommendations for improving ESG alignment
- Recommendations prioritize improvements in the primary focus area
- Recommendations include actions (e.g., "Consider Divesting", "Increase Holdings", "Research")

### US6: Performance and Scalability
As a system administrator, I want the API to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently so that we can provide timely analysis to all our clients.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The API can handle at least 100 requests per second
- Response time is under 2 seconds for portfolios with up to 100 holdings
- The system scales automatically to handle increased load during peak times

### US7: Data Security and Privacy
As a compliance officer, I want to ensure that all data processed by the API is secure and compliant with financial regulations so that we protect our clients' sensitive information.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All data transmissions are encrypted using industry-standard protocols
- The API adheres to GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data protection regulations
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is stored longer than necessary for analysis

### US8: API Documentation
As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation so that I can easily integrate the multi-objective ESG analysis into our existing systems.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Documentation includes detailed descriptions of all endpoints, request/response formats, and error codes
- Interactive API explorer (e.g., Swagger UI) is provided for testing
- Sample code snippets are provided in popular programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript)

## Technical Requirements
- RESTful API design following OpenAPI 3.0 specifications

Key updates in this revised EPIC BRD:

1. Expanded the scope to multi-objective ESG analysis across all three dimensions (E, S, G).
2. Introduced the concept of a primary ESG focus in the objectives and analysis.
3. Updated user stories to reflect multi-dimensional analysis and primary focus considerations.
4. Modified the ESG Score Calculation (US3) to include individual E, S, G scores and weighted overall score.
5. Updated the Alignment Analysis (US4) to cover all ESG dimensions with emphasis on the primary focus.
6. Revised the Actionable Recommendations (US5) to prioritize the primary focus area.
7. Kept the Performance and Scalability, Data Security and Privacy, and API Documentation user stories largely the same, as they remain critical regardless of the analysis approach.
8. Updated the Success Metrics to include improvement across all ESG dimensions.

This revised EPIC BRD provides a more comprehensive and flexible approach to ESG analysis, aligning with the multi-objective nature of ESG investing while still allowing for prioritization of specific areas. It maintains the core structure and key considerations of the original BRD while expanding its scope and capabilities to meet more diverse and nuanced ESG analysis needs.
