# AI Model Showcase with Streamlit

This project is a comprehensive collection of experiments and demonstrations using various AI models, showcased through Streamlit applications. It serves as a playground for exploring different AI technologies and their applications.

## Project Overview

This repository contains multiple Python scripts that demonstrate the use of various AI models and libraries, including:

- OpenAI's GPT models
- Google's Gemini
- Anthropic's Claude
- Mistral AI
- Groq
- LlamaIndex
- Langchain

The project uses Streamlit to create interactive web applications that showcase these AI models' capabilities.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Model Chat Interfaces**: Implementations of chat-based applications using different AI providers (OpenAI, Claude AI, Together AI).
   ```python:basics/chat_open_source.py
   startLine: 1
   endLine: 40
   ```

2. **Image Processing with AI**: Demonstrations of AI-powered image analysis and processing.
   ```python:gemini_google_basics/gemini_vision_pro.py
   startLine: 1
   endLine: 25
   ```

3. **Financial Analysis**: AI-powered financial data analysis and visualization.
   ```python:groq/groq_finance_exmaple_streamlit.py
   startLine: 1
   endLine: 14
   ```

4. **Document Analysis**: AI-powered document processing and analysis using LlamaIndex.
   ```python:llama_index_basics/document_agent.py
   startLine: 1
   endLine: 35
   ```

5. **Streamlit UI Enhancements**: Various Streamlit UI improvements and custom components.
   ```python:streamlit_cheats/1.34/background-colors/0_ðŸŽ¨_About.py
   startLine: 1
   endLine: 51
   ```

6. **Progress Tracking**: Implementation of progress bars in Streamlit applications.
   ```python:streamlit_cheats/streamlit_stqdm_demo.py
   startLine: 1
   endLine: 45
   ```
