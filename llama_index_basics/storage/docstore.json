As you ponder whether or not this book \nis for you, think about your life.  How well are you performing in the areas of your life \nyou deem to be most important? Are you thriving or just surviving? Are you at the top \nof your game or sitting on the bench, watching others play, wishing you could be the star \nperformer? \nNo matter how you\u2019ve answered these questions, you\u2019re going to want to read this book. \nWhy? You already know that good performance coaching is like eating healthy food. What \nyou eat in\uf002uences your energy and your body\u2019s performance. So eating healthy food just \nmakes good sense.\nBut what controls how well you perform?  What you think controls how you perform -- \npure cause and effect.  Your thinking is the cause. Your performance is the effect. So think-\ning the right thoughts (and acting on them) makes great sense. In fact, it makes Perfor-\nmance Champions. And a steady diet of \u201chigh-performance thought food\u201d is contained in \n177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class .  It\u2019s your recipe for a great life, the \n\u201cthought food\u201d of champions.\nOh, did I mention that you, too, are a coach? You are the one who chooses your thought \nfood.  You\u2019re the one who swallows your thought food. And, you\u2019re the only one who is \naccountable for what you swallow (think). For better or worse, you are your own head \ncoach, the coach of what thoughts are in your head. \nBut don\u2019t despair, Steve is here to save the day. Steve is my good friend and your primary \nassistant coach. He\u2019s here to assist you in making the best choices possible -- the thoughts \nyou feed your brain.

As a junior tennis player competing \nthroughout the United States from ages 7-18, I became fascinated with what it takes to \nbecome a champion. My dream was to be ranked among the Top 10 players in the world, \nbut I fell short. At my best, I hovered around the Top 500 in the world, and that\u2019s as high as \nI could seem to reach. Deep down, I knew I had the talent to make my dream a reality, and \nI knew the missing link was mental. After I hung up my racquet for the last time, I became \nobsessed with uncovering the mental toughness secrets of champions. Starting in 1984, I \nspent every free moment conducting interviews with champions, reading their books and \nstudying everything I could get my hands on about the psychology of peak performance. \nMy friends said I was obsessed. They were right. This book is the result of my 20-year \nobsession. \nWhen I started to implement the ideas in this book, my whole life changed. It wasn\u2019t over-\nnight, but sometimes it seemed like it. There\u2019s no magic here, just practical thought pro-\ncesses, habits and philosophies drawn from the greatest performers in the world. \nThis book contains no theories. Every secret comes straight from the street of experience, \neither my own or that of our clients. This book is loaded with ideas you can implement \nimmediately. Some will be familiar, and some new. All of them have the power to catapult \nyour results, no matter how high you\u2019re \uf002ying. As a matter of fact, the people who get the \nmost value out of our mental toughness process are the world class. They are always trying \nto gain an edge and get better, which is one of the reasons I think so highly of them.\nI\u2019ve held nothing back in this book, which means that at times you may \uf001nd yourself \nslightly offended. This book is constantly comparing \u2018average people\u2019 with \u2018world-class \npeople\u2019. These terms are used to get your attention and make you ask, \u201cWhich one am I?\u201d  \nOf course there are no \u2018average people\u2019, just average performers getting average results. \nWe are all equal as human beings. I simply use these terms in reference to performance and \nresults. \nIt\u2019s been said that speakers and writers espouse wisdom on the very topic they need most. \nNow that you know my story, you know this is true for me. After 20 years of studying and \nteaching mental toughness to people throughout the United States, Canada, and 10 other \ncountries, I can honestly tell you that many times I still think like a complete amateur, \noperating out of the same middle-class consciousness that I ridicule in this book. After all \nthese years, my mental toughness growth is still a work in progress.  The good news is that \nmental toughness is a skill that can be learned, and the tougher you get, the bigger you\u2019ll \ndream and the more fun you\u2019ll have. \nMental toughness is the ticket to becoming one of the great ones. \nI hope you\u2019ll decide to join the club.\nSteve Siebold\nMay 1, 2004\nMexico City, Mexico\nx", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3147, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "141b9786-e0c0-4c2d-8017-91923b3575a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "141b9786-e0c0-4c2d-8017-91923b3575a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samisabir-idrissi/code/python/streamlit_ai_showcase/data/177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5799440, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d51c9d3-17bb-4ca0-80a4-52f24e3f1a9d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samisabir-idrissi/code/python/streamlit_ai_showcase/data/177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5799440, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "hash": "a49063d2bca97864162ae44e1e0774b5ab9cd12798855e9f8c373ec729e62166", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "177 MENTAL  TOUGHNESS  SECRETS  OF THE WORLD  CLASS", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 51, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c073c0e3-cb06-4219-9a8b-d6d2612d6f8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "c073c0e3-cb06-4219-9a8b-d6d2612d6f8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samisabir-idrissi/code/python/streamlit_ai_showcase/data/177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5799440, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e9dac9c6-e8ff-4282-a90c-5786fe7146c0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samisabir-idrissi/code/python/streamlit_ai_showcase/data/177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5799440, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "hash": "c8afb2139169d1421f5f8ac99a55cd495e4d7fd2673d1665dede5e2c608efe9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "177 MENTAL  TOUGHNESS  SECRETS  OF THE WORLD  CLASS\n1\nThe World Class Operates \nFrom Objective Reality\nIn 20 years of competing, coaching and working \nwith performers from various \uf001elds, I\u2019ve discov-\nered most amateurs suffer from mild to severe \ndelusion in relation to their efforts and competen-\ncies. In other words, most people delude themselves \ninto thinking they are working harder then they are, \nand that they are more competent than they actually \nare. Of the \uf001ve major levels of conscious awareness, \n(poverty, working, middle, upper, and world) my \nexperience has been that performers at the middle-\nclass levels of consciousness suffer the grandest delu-\nsions. The poverty level is barely surviving and living \nin a very harsh set of circumstances. The working \nclass is punching a mental time clock and counting \nthe days until retirement. They\u2019re usually not expecting much, and no one around them \nexpects much, either. They are typically not concerned about climbing any higher. It\u2019s the \nmiddle class that is most incongruent with reality. They are operating at a high enough \nlevel to understand that higher levels exist. Although they don\u2019t expect to get there, the \nthought crosses their minds from time to time. Because of their low expectations, their \nactions are incongruent with their desires. In other words, they want to live the life of the \nworld class, but are unwilling to pay the price. Since this reality is too harsh to bear, they \ndelude themselves into thinking they are doing everything in their power to get ahead. Of \ncourse, they\u2019re not. They\u2019ll tell you they\u2019re putting in far more time than they are. They\u2019ll \nswear they are thinking about their vision all the time, but they\u2019re not. The world class \nis brutally honest with themselves, and they tend to look reality in the face. They err on \nthe side of over-practicing and over-preparing. Champions know that, to ascend to the top, \nyou must \uf001rst be operating from a mindset of objective reality.

Even in the wealthiest \nnation in the world, 99% of the population is being \ncontrolled by money. The effect is lack of money. The \ncause is thinking. Albert Einstein once said, \u201ca problem \ncannot be solved at the level of consciousness in which \nit occurs.\u201d Knowing this, champions raise their level of \nconsciousness by studying how the world class creates wealth. The middle class believes \nformal education is the answer to acquiring wealth, yet very few academics are wealthy. \nThey seek advanced degrees and certi\uf001cations and are confounded when these things don\u2019t \nbring them riches.  While the great ones are strong advocates of higher education, they \ndon\u2019t believe it has much to do with acquiring money. The middle class trades time for \nmoney. The world class trades ideas that solve problems for money. Money \uf002ows like \nwater from ideas. The middle class often scorns the world class out of frustration over a \nlack of money, yet the answer to earning more than they can spend has been in their lap \ntheir whole lives. Ideas -- it\u2019s such a simple concept that the majority misses it. The poverty \nclass talks about and regurgitates the past; the middle class talks about other people; and \nthe world class talks about ideas. Professional performers know money doesn\u2019t care which \ndirection it \uf002ows. They know the world will bend over backward to make them rich if it \nwill help them solve their problems. About 150 years ago, Karl Marx was sure the working \nclass, as a whole, would rise up and overcome oppression if they had a chance. What Marx \ndidn\u2019t \uf001gure into the equation was the poverty-driven thought process of the people.

Cham-\npions use their critical thinking skills to make a \nclear distinction between truth and fact. Fact is real-\nity. Truth is our perception of reality, and percep-\ntions are subjective. One person perceives giving \nto charity as an expense, while another perceives \nit as an investment in someone else\u2019s life. The fact \nis that many people give to charity; whether it\u2019s an \nexpense or an investment is a perception. Which line of thinking represents truth? Both. In \nthe minds of individuals, perception equals truth. This subtle distinction allows the great \nones to understand themselves and others at a higher level of awareness. The masses tend \nto operate from truth, which is often a distorted version of facts. Champions make deci-\nsions based on facts, not feelings. The world class also uses this understanding of truth \nand fact in their mental programming. The great ones know the conscious mind functions \nmost effectively on fact, while the subconscious can be programmed with truth. Since the \nsubconscious is unable to make the distinction between fact and truth, champions program \ntheir subconscious minds to believe their visions, dreams and ideas as truths. Because the \nsubconscious doesn\u2019t have the ability to reject an idea, it accepts it as truth and begins to \ncreate behaviors that are congruent with this new \u201ctruth.\u201d The conscious mind knows this \n\u201ctruth\u201d is not fact, and tension begins to build between the conscious and subconscious,  \ncreating cognitive dissonance. As a result, the two go to work to create congruency.

Instead of leader-\nship through the outdated command-and-control, do-it-or-you\u2019re-\uf001red model, progressive \nmanagers are constantly asking their employees questions and taking careful note of their \nanswers. The great ones know that most people \nare unaware of what makes them tick in terms of \ntheir emotional motivators. The only way to help \na person discover the hidden power locked up in \ntheir psyche is through asking probing questions. \nLearning occurs at two levels during this intro-\nspective process. The \uf001rst level is when the person \ndigging down inside himself becomes aware of the \nemotions driving his behavior, and the second is \nthe manager\u2019s awareness as it relates to which but-\ntons to push when it\u2019s time to motivate his charge \nto action.

Since \nhuman beings are primarily emotional creatures, \nit\u2019s obvious which method has the most power. \nFacilitating the introspective process in another \nperson requires patience and time, and the great \nones are willing to invest.

Like champions, average people tend \nto be a product of their mental programming from \nchildhood. People of in\uf002uence, such as parents, teach-\ners, coaches, religious leaders, and others were the pri-\nmary builders and shapers  of our early belief systems. In most cases, this programming \nis limiting because it comes from people who believe they are limited. That\u2019s why aver-\nage people are saddled with a set of beliefs that are more about survival than success. Aver-\nage people have been programmed to avoid pain at all costs, which promotes a \u2018playing \nnot to lose\u2019 mentality. Many world-class performers were raised with these same beliefs, \nyet learned to reprogram themselves somewhere along the way. Champions learn how \nto develop empowering beliefs and invest a substantial amount of time solidifying those \nbeliefs, mostly through their own self-talk. With guidance from coaches and mentors, \nchampions monitor the words they use. They know reprogramming is a never-ending \nactivity. Some people even consider this process \u2018positive brainwashing.\u2019 When aspiring \nchampions learn they can program any belief they wish, and through repetitious, ongoing \nself-talk, build that belief into a foundation for their consciousness, it\u2019s a revelation. A \nworld-class belief system can be created from scratch, no matter what your age, upbring-\ning or current lot in life. A world-class belief system is a primary factor in the making of \na champion, and every great performer knows it. While average people see champions as \nmore intelligent, the champions know better.

While average \npeople are complaining about the sacri\uf001ces they \nhave to make to be great, the champions have already made those decisions and continue \nto move forward. Erratic performance is the result of erratic thinking, so the \uf001rst step \nin mental toughness training is gaining mental clarity. Champions invest an inordinate \namount of time thinking, planning and clarifying their goals and targets, as well as mapping \nout an exact action plan for attainment. Consistency in performance is the direct result of \nknowing why it is necessary to perform well and the bene\uf001ts that will accrue, especially \nwhen the going gets tough and the pain sets in. Consistency is also created by practice. \nChampions are usually thought of as the people with the most talent, and sometimes this \nis true.

The sheer force of \nthe collective emotion is so overwhelming that it mentally elevates the consciousness of \nthe individual performers, which enables them to tap into a higher level of intelligence. \nThe secular philosophy is that the performers are able to access more of their brain when \nthey are operating in this altered state of consciousness. The spiritual philosophy says that \nperformers have raised their rate of vibration to the same frequency as the force that cre-\nated the universe.

The heart of the champions\u2019 open-minded attitude is in their spirit-based \nconsciousness, which is a mindset devoid of the need to hold on to the past. Most new \nideas with the power to revolutionize people\u2019s lives never make it past the amateurs\u2019 ego, \nwhich is rooted in fear of the unknown and marked by pre-judgment, pretense and frustra-\ntion.

Champions believe the whole is \ngreater than the sum of the parts when it comes to achievement. These people have a tre-\nmendous ability to persuade others to join forces with them, and work in a spirit of fero-\ncious cooperation. Achievement has less to do with stroking their egos and more to do with \npersonal growth and development \u2013 not just their own, but also that of the team. Champi-\nons get as big a kick from watching a team member grow in the process of achieving the \ngoal as they do in actually achieving the goal. They realize the true value of achievement is \nas a catalyst for  growth. Generally speaking, the more cooperative the champion, the more \nsuccessful they tend to be. The great individual is no match for the great team. 26\nAction Step for Today:  Rate yourself on your level of \ncooperation.

The masses \nhave the same talent and opportunity as the \nworld class; yet choose to play it safe to avoid the \npain of failure and the agony of (temporary) defeat. At \nMental Toughness University, we have a scale called \nThe Five Levels of Mental Toughness, which is a tool \nto help people determine at what level they are perform-\ning. The \uf001rst level is called Playing Not to Lose, which \nis doing just enough to avoid getting \uf001red. The next \nlevel up is Playing To Cruise, which is mentally cruis-\ning through the job without really engaging in any \nserious thought. The next level is Playing to Improve, \nwhich is when  performers begin to actively engage \ntheir thoughts and feelings in the task at hand, attempting to get better. The level above this \nis Playing To Compete, which is when performers begin to believe they are capable of beat-\ning out their competition and being the best. This level is primarily ego-driven where win-\nning is the main objective. Performers operating at this level often become very successful \nand powerful, but are sometimes left with hollow feelings of \u201cIs this all there is?\u201d The high-\nest level is Playing to Win, which occurs when the performer moves from competition to \ncreation, where the primary goal is to be the best they can be. Knowing that creativity and \nfear cannot co-exist, these people are competing only with themselves with the objective \nof being better today than they were yesterday. The Playing to Win philosophy is rooted \nin a spirit-based consciousness operating from thoughts of love and abundance. Fear and \nscarcity have no place at this level of thinking. These performers are fearlessly seeking \nwhat Dr. Abraham Maslow referred to as Self-Actualization, or becoming all that one has \nthe potential to become. The most powerful belief performers operating at this level pos-\nsess is that they cannot fail; they can only learn and grow. With their potential in front and \ntheir fear behind them, champions are able to move beyond the boundaries of competition \nand create what the masses believe is impossible.30", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2547, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29b63b16-8f59-400b-b6c8-094d3626399e": {"__data__": {"id_": "29b63b16-8f59-400b-b6c8-094d3626399e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samisabir-idrissi/code/python/streamlit_ai_showcase/data/177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5799440, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aafceef9-fd5d-41bb-9186-48dc377b69a0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samisabir-idrissi/code/python/streamlit_ai_showcase/data/177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5799440, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "hash": "6710cef1a22925424ed212a14b3e8f5b0cf938481cf7561db89272fb38312f9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "177 MENTAL  TOUGHNESS  SECRETS  OF THE WORLD  CLASS\nAction Step for Today:  Examine the 5 Levels of Mental \nToughness and identify the level you inhabit most often \nin performance situations.

The next discovery I made was that this same positive expecta-\ntion could be installed in anyone who wishes to possess \nit. It\u2019s a programming process that is easy to do; all it \ntakes is desire and persistence.

The fear of public humiliation is too much for the ego to bear; \nso most people develop a tremendous fear of speaking to groups. Realizing the incredible \nforce public speaking can be in their careers, many champions have faced this fear head-on \nand later fell in love with the emotional high public speaking offers. Champions have \nlearned emotional strength and power lies on the other side of fear. On the other end of the \nspectrum, amateurs usually settle for the short-term gain of avoiding what they fear. \u201c \u2018Come to the edge,\u2019 He said.\nThey said, \u2018We are afraid.\u2019\n\u2018Come to the edge,\u2019 He said.\nThey came.

Upper-class performers are full of emo-\ntional \uf001re that is usually fueled by the fear of fail-\nure. While fear can be a tremendous motivator, it \ncreates a lot of pain and suffering in the process. \nOperating out of a fear and scarcity based consciousness is a playing not to lose strategy, \nand through the law of attraction acts as a magnet for additional thoughts of fear and scar-\ncity to enter the performers mind. These thoughts eventually manifest more fear and scar-\ncity on the physical plane. The upper class includes some of the most successful people in \nthe world, who are also some of the saddest. The fear that propels them to achieve is the \nsame emotion that robs them of their ful\uf001llment. The upper class consciousness is rooted \nin ego, where the pain of losing is stronger than the pleasure of winning. Because of the \nfear this thought process attracts, the upper class tends to suffer much more than the world \nclass.

The \nirony is that champions create so much value in their quest for ful\uf001llment that they \noften develop substantial riches. Amateurs are usually looking for the quick buck. They \nbelieve being rich will \uf001ll the hole they feel inside, although few of them can say how \nmuch money that would require. In truth, no amount is suf\uf001cient, because the hole can \nonly be \uf001lled by feelings of ful\uf001llment. The great ones \uf001nd ful\uf001llment in their everyday \nwork and activities. They never really chase ful\uf001llment, yet they experience it simply by \ndoing their work. Amateurs believe money and the \nthings money will buy are the keys to peace and ful-\n\uf001llment. Professional performers gravitate toward \nthings that create a sense of satisfaction in and of \nthemselves. Ful\uf001llment is a mental state champi-\nons experience as a result of their elevated aware-\nness.

The \ngreat ones are focused on the cause, rather than the effect. As a result, the effects (or results) \ntake care of themselves.

While \naverage people plot revenge, champions \nrelease their enemies and move on. The amateur \napproach stems from ego; the professional \napproach from spirit. The habit of forgiveness is a \nsigni\uf001cant distinction between the masses and the \nchampions. Professional performers understand \nthat mental toughness and power ultimately come \nfrom a mindset of love \u2013 love for what they do, who they are and for the people with whom \nthey interact. This is not to be confused with the Age of Aquarius and the free love move-\nment of the 1960s, although they were probably on the right track in the beginning.  All \nhuman actions and reactions have their root in one of two forms of consciousness: fear or \nlove. If people were primarily logical creatures, this concept wouldn\u2019t make sense. Human \nbeings, however, are primarily emotional creatures who often operate in irrational ways. \nChampions know this, which is the reason they\u2019re able to forgive. Emotional creatures who \noperate at a lower level of conscious awareness tend to say ignorant things and behave in \nthoughtless ways. Expecting human beings to behave logically all the time is like expect-\ning machines to feel emotion. The great ones operate from a love-based consciousness that \nrecognizes the emotion-based irrational behavior of people. Champions are much more \nforgiving than average people because of this knowledge. \u201cThe weak can never forgive. \nForgiveness is the attitude of the \nstrong.\u201d \n  \n\u2013 Mahatma Ghandi, \n1869-1948, Indian leader\nAction Step for Today: Make a \nlist of all of the people you feel \nhave slighted you to some degree, \nand give yourself the gift of a life-\ntime by forgiving them.

Fear-based leaders succumb to politics and pressure, which cripples \ntheir ability to lead. Professional thinkers operate out of love and abundance and \nfearlessly lead their people to become more than they ever believed possible. The most \ncommon commodity in corporate America is the sales manager who craves the approval \nand friendship of his sales team.

Both of these manag-\ners are performing out of fear, and are both a dime a \ndozen. The world-class leader is neither dictator nor \nbaby sitter. Great sales leaders have only two objec-\ntives: drive sales and develop people. Sometimes that \nmeans being unpopular and pushing people beyond \ntheir comfort zones, and other times it means being \nthere for a team member who has hit rock bottom. \nWorld-class leaders are chameleons who are able to \nchange and adapt to any situation, always with the \nsame goal in mind: bringing out the best in the people \nthey lead. Sometimes that means being tough. Other times it means being tender.

This need can easily become an addic-\ntion for a person who craves acceptance and validation \nfrom the outside world. Professional performers evolve \nto a higher level of consciousness where outside \napproval is no longer necessary. Champions still enjoy \nthe accolades and acceptance of people they respect, but \nare no longer motivated to take action to achieve this \nacceptance. The great ones are often motivated through \nself-expression, by the need to share their unique tal-\nents and abilities with the world. Abraham Maslow, the \nfather of humanistic psychology, said it this way: \u201cIn \norder for human beings to reach self-actualization, they \nmust become all they can be. The writer must write. The painter must paint. The salesper-\nson must sell.\u201d The world class doesn\u2019t do these things to please other people, gain noto-\nriety or get rich. They do it because it expresses who they are to themselves. In essence, \nchampions learn who they are in the act of self-expression, and often choose to share them-\nselves with the world. The act of proving oneself is based in ego and rooted in the fear \nof not being good enough. The act of expressing oneself is based in spirit and rooted in \nthe love of wanting to share and celebrate a person is uniqueness and inner beauty. Prov-\ning oneself is a process that must be forced onto others because of the attachment the per-\nformer has to the outcome. Expressing oneself is a natural process that has no attachment \nto anything or anyone. The more praise they get, the more they need to feel good about \nthemselves. Expressing oneself creates feelings of ful\uf001llment in the act itself, regardless \nof any outcome. It\u2019s one of the reasons the great ones are more mentally tough than their \namateur counterparts. \u201cThe ego-driven middle \nclass and upper class are \nout to prove themselves. \nThe spirit-driven world \nclass wishes only to express \nthemselves.

The difference in strategy is profound, and requires something only \nthe world class possesses: supreme self-con\uf001dence. The middle class sees this as a crass \noperational strategy of using people to climb the ladder of success. The world class sees it \nas a symbiotic, synergistic relationship of give and take.

Per-\nsistence, to amateurs, is never really a factor, because \nthey haven\u2019t focused on any single goal long enough \nto be persistent. When pros determine what they want, \nthey burn their vision into their minds on a daily basis. \nThey become obsessed with attaining the goal at almost \nany cost. At this stage, persistence becomes the primary \nfactor in their success. Amateurs are often impressed by \nthis, yet the champions are simply following their pas-\nsions and refusing to look back. They reach a mental \nstate in which the failure to persist is no longer an \noption. The great ones know the longer they hang tough, \nthe greater the odds of victory. What looks like Hercu-\nlean persistence to the outside world is really just the \nmanifestation of world-class mental clarity in action. \nChampions decide what they want, down to the last \ndetail, and then wage war to get it. Their sense of pur-\npose and dogged persistence is a hard combination to beat. The great ones become unstop-\npable because they\u2019ve convinced themselves there is no way to fail. This subjective \nperception is one of the most common thought processes of the world class. While the rest \nof the world watches with doubt and disbelief, champions talk themselves into believing \nthat winning is their destiny and defeat is impossible.

People operating at the upper-class level of awareness tend to be unafraid, aggres-\nsive, ultra-competitive warriors who approach life like a battle.

Their \nfear of losing overwhelms them to the point \nof physical, emotional and spiritual breakdown. The \nchampion knows that the secret to performing well \nunder pressure has more to do with their perception of \nthe event than the event itself. While the amateur is \ntelling himself that he must win, the pro is reminding \nherself that it\u2019s only a game. Both performers want to \nwin, but the pro always outperforms the amateur under pressure because she has learned \nhow to calm her nerves by putting things in perspective. Some people claim that champions \nperform better than any other group under pressure. This is not true. There is an inverse \nrelationship between pressure and performance, no matter who you are or what you do. As \npressure increases, performance decreases. This occurs whether you\u2019re Donald Trump or \nDonald Duck. The reason champions get better results is because they have trained them-\nselves how to perceive the so-called pressure situation. The amateur perceives it as a threat, \nwhich triggers a \uf001ght or \uf002ight response from the mind and body. Physiologically speaking, \nthe performer believes he is literally \uf001ghting for his life. Meanwhile, the pro has convinced \nherself that this situation is just a game, and that nobody dies from losing a game. This \nchampionship self-talk can be learned and implemented by anyone, but is rarely picked \nup on by amateurs.

Once \nshe reaches a level of competence that \nsatis\uf001es her job requirements, ongoing analysis \nand improvement are no longer a priority. The \nworld class is constantly analyzing, critiquing, \nand giving themselves feedback. One of the \nthings a professional performer pays close atten-\ntion to is her level of attraction to other people, \nespecially prospects and customers. At Mental \nToughness University, we call it Rate of Vibra-\ntion, or ROV. The concept of ROV is simple: it\u2019s \na combination of the mental and physical energy \nbeing projected from one person to another. You might call it charisma in action. The \uf001ve \ncomponents of ROV are energy, enthusiasm, con\uf001dence, belief and clarity. The sum total \nof these components is your ROV. At Mental Toughness University, we ask our sales and \nmanagement clients to track their ROV on a scale of one to one thousand before and after \nevery sales call or coaching session. The purpose is to convince the performer a high ROV \ncreates greater attraction and response from the prospect or customer. Then, we show them \nhow to raise their ROV in seconds. Professional performers have been using this concept \nfor years. (It falls under various names.) The bottom line: the pro always contemplates \nwhat she thinks about in performance situations, and implementing strategies and tech-\nniques such as ROV creates better results. No matter where she is in her career, a cham-\npion is borderline obsessed with improving. She continues to learn new ideas and ways of \nimproving her performance. Meanwhile, the middle-class performer is still doing things \nthe way she was twenty years ago. The difference is more about consciousness than any-\nthing else. \u201cLadies, do you want to know \nhow to take a one-carat diamond \nand turn it into a two-and-a-half-\ncarat diamond?

Amateurs \nuse rewards for themselves and their subordinates for \nachieving results. Sounds like a good concept, doesn\u2019t \nit? While it\u2019s not a bad idea, champions have a much \nbetter system. Champions set execution-based goals \nover which they have total control. The results they \nare aiming for, but don\u2019t have complete control over, \nare known as Targets. The great ones aim for their Tar-\ngets but focus on their goals. For example, salespeople \nset a goal to make a certain number of calls. If they \nfail to make that number of calls, they fail to reach the \ngoal. They are reprimanded and possibly penalized. If \nthey accomplish the number of calls, they automati-\ncally earn the reward, no matter the outcome of those \ncalls. That\u2019s execution-based goal setting. The philos-\nophy is simple: reward people for doing what they say they are going to do, based on \nactivities they can control. To reward someone for increasing sales, market share, or any \noutcome-based goal is a reward for something they only played a part in achieving, and \nthey are being penalized under the same criteria. It only makes partial sense, and it can \ndestroy the motivation of the performer. Rewarding execution-based performance is the \nwave of the future, because it\u2019s a much more accurate award, actually deserved. The pri-\nority is still set on bottom-line results, but the focus is toward high-quality, consistent \nexecution. Reward performers for keeping their word and you build a success cycle of \ncon\uf001dence and enthusiasm. \u201cThe goals, targets and \nrewards system is the \nwave of the future.

Many are quick to \nadd that the people who programmed them \n\u2013 parents, teachers, coaches, ministers and \nadults of in\uf002uence \u2013 were doing the best \nthey could, based on their level of awareness \nat the time. It\u2019s easy to criticize in hind-\nsight, yet champions don\u2019t feel the need to \ndo this. They want to take control of their \nown reprogramming process and install the \nhabits, philosophies, traits and beliefs that \nempower, rather than limit them. Middle-\nclass performers scoff at things like repro-\ngramming and tend to hold on to what they were taught, no matter how poor their teachers\u2019 \nthinking. The pros use two primary methods of reprogramming. First and foremost, they \nalter the language they use when they talk to themselves and others. They adjust their \nlanguage from the middle-class to the world-class level. They create self-talk scripts and \nrepeat them daily until the change takes place. The second thing they do is use the power \nof mental pictures, or visualization training, to adjust how they experience events. The \ncombination of these two change processes has a powerful effect on the mindset of the \nperformer. Sadly, the concepts are so simple that most people miss them. Meanwhile, the \ngreat ones keep getting stronger and stronger by developing world-class thoughts, feelings \nand attitudes through the reprogramming process. \u201cThe programming that you accept \nfrom others, and the conscious \nand unconscious directives, pic-\ntures, feelings and thoughts that \nyou transmit to yourself, will \uf001nd \na place in your own internal con-\ntrol center.

It helps alter the way they respond to events outside their \ncontrol. For example, a salesperson makes a presentation to a customer who treats \nthe salesperson poorly and disrespectfully. The emotional response of amateurs would \nbe anger. The pro realizes treating people disrespectfully is classic amateur behavior. \nThrough the Ten-Step Change Process, the performer writes down the activating event \n(the disrespectful customer). Next, he writes down \nhis response. Then he decides if that response is help-\ning or hurting. The next step is to decide whether his \nresponse was rational or irrational. Next, he examines \nhis thought process thoroughly, and identi\uf001es his ulti-\nmate response if this were to happen again. He then \nmentally rehearses implementing the new response. \nNext, he creates a written script of the new response, \nand rehearses the new response twice a day, visually \nand verbally. He examines his response the next time \nthe event occurs. If he is satis\uf001ed with the result, he has successfully transformed his \nresponse to this event. If he\u2019s not yet satis\uf001ed, he continues the process until the desired \nbehavior change takes place. This is one of the most effective change processes of the \nworld class. Knowing it is worthless unless you use it. Are you ready to go pro yet? Imag-\nine the potential if you could alter every major response that you encountered on a daily \nbasis. Would that elevate you to the next level? \u201cIt\u2019s not the event itself that \ndoes us in, it\u2019s how we per-\nceive it.\u201d \n\u2013 Dr. Karl Menninger, \npsychiatrist, author\nAction Step for Today: Select one event that triggers a negative \nemotional response and put it through the Ten-Step Change Pro-\ncess. For example, do you get angry when someone cuts you off \nin traf\uf001c, or when people treat you disrespectfully, or when your \nson or daughter gets a poor grade on a report card? Our habitual \nresponses are based on our perceptions of what these events mean \nand our perceptions can be altered or even totally changed in a very \nshort period of time through reprogramming.

The world class is \nextremely sensitive to time. The great ones have a \nsense of urgency because they are operating at a level \nof awareness that constantly reminds them the pres-\nent moment is all any of us really have. The world \nclass is on a mission to ful\uf001ll a dream, and they know \nthe clock is ticking. The only time amateur perform-\ners develop a sense of urgency is toward the end of \nthe day, week, or before they go on vacation. Imagine \nif they channeled that same energy, enthusiasm and focus into their everyday performance. \nWorldwide productivity would probably triple in one day. Professional performers con-\nstantly remind themselves that life is short and if they are going to make something happen, \nnow is the time. This thought process makes the middle class uncomfortable. Remember, \nthey prefer to operate in a state of mild delusion. Knowing the clock is ticking and none \nof us know how much time we have left is too uncomfortable for emotional amateurs. For \npros, who operate from objective reality, it\u2019s a primary motivating force. It\u2019s one of the \nreasons the great ones tend to pursue large, magni\uf001cent visions.

If you know the answer, you can implement this world-\nclass philosophy immediately. If not, make it your mission to discover the embers that burn \nwithin your soul and focus that passion on what you really want. Don\u2019t stop until you \uf001nd \nit. When you do, create a sense of urgency to act on it now. Don\u2019t hesitate. Pursue your \ndream boldly and fearlessly.

Professional performers understand \nthat amateurs suffer the consequences of living out of \na fear-based consciousness. Most pros are recovering \namateurs who woke up one day and made a decision \nto change. They empathize with the amateur mindset and do everything they can to lead \nthem to the next level of consciousness. Champions believe the greatest leaders are the \ngreatest servants, and that all of us are here to lend a hand to one another. In order to \nembrace this mindset and become a conduit for positive change, a person must be operating \nfrom spirit, as opposed to ego. Champions serve without asking or expecting anything in \nreturn. Of course, in accordance with the law of cause and effect, they are richly rewarded \nfor their efforts. The middle-class consciousness is not operating at a level high enough to \nsee this law in action. When we were kids, most of us learned the saying, \u201cThe more you \ngive, the more you get.\u201d Somewhere along the way, many of us have forgotten this piece \nof ancient wisdom. As a result, amateurs are always seeing how much they can get without \nhaving to give. On the other hand, the world class continues to give out of love and activate \nthis law. The law is the same for everyone, yet amateurs don\u2019t believe in it. They are afraid \nthey will serve someone without getting anything in return, and they are afraid they\u2019ll \nget hurt again. Fear draws them inside themselves and reinforces their amateur behavior. \nMeanwhile, the world class is humbly serving society and being handsomely rewarded. \u201cThe measure of a man \nis . . . in the number of \npeople who he serves.\u201d \n\u2013 Paul D.

It\u2019s \nno wonder amateurs are no match for pros \u2013 it\u2019s not \neven a level playing \uf001eld. Champions are motivated \nby the idea that their security is in their ability to per-\nform.

The world class \nknows that, if any form of security exists in the universe, it is within their thoughts. They \nare willing to court doubt and darkness along the road to enlightenment.

Amateur performers are \naware of what vision is, but don\u2019t believe in the con-\ncept or themselves enough to create and manifest \ntheir own visions. The middle-class consciousness \nneeds the emotional support of other people to make \ntheir visions reality. This is where the world class \nbreaks away from the pack. The world-class con-\nsciousness is so powerful it needs little, if any, out-\nside support to maintain motivation and direction toward its vision. The great ones have \nthe con\uf001dence and clarity to go it alone, if necessary. That said, professional performers \nare the \uf001rst group to build mentor and support teams. The difference lies in their mental \nstrength and laser-like focus on their purpose and mission in life. Vision, to amateurs, is a \ncompany\u2019s statement on the \uf001rst page of its annual report. Vision, to pros, is a clearly writ-\nten, ten- to twenty-page (on average) double-spaced document they see as their personal \nDeclaration of Independence. It is the result of years of soul-searching and self-discovery. \nIt\u2019s the reason they\u2019re doing everything they do. They read it every day and think about it \nall the time. All the great philosophers of the last two thousand years have agreed on at least \none thing: we become what we think about. Champions know this, so they think about their \nvision all the time. This is the primary reason for the psychological separation between the \ngood and the great. Good performers turn off their vision when it\u2019s quitting time. Great \nperformers never stop thinking about it. As a result, when the good and the great go head to \nhead, it\u2019s a mismatch from the start. The great ones create their vision, and then their vision \ncreates them. \u201cVision . . . it reaches beyond \nthe thing that is, into the \nconception of what can be. \nImagination gives you the \npicture.

They are savvy enough to know none of us will live long enough to learn \nall the wisdom of the world from our own experience.

The upper class is \ndriven by ego and power. While some of them build \n\uf001nancial fortunes, they often suffer from a lack of \nmeaning and ful\uf001llment in their lives. This is evident \nby the number of broken relationships many of them \nexperience.

Their egocentric addiction renders them blind to the simple truth that ful\uf001llment \nand happiness cannot be coerced or purchased.

The irony is that many great \nperformers become successful without ever chasing success. Their journey to ful\uf001llment \nthrough helping other people creates success by natural law.

Ask champions how much weight they \nneed to lose, and you\u2019ll get an accurate number. \nAsk about money, and you\u2019ll \uf001nd they take it very \nseriously. They know how much they have and \nhow to leverage it to get more. Ask about their rela-\ntionships, and you\u2019ll \uf001nd most of them put a great deal of time and effort into keeping \ntheir relationships strong and solid. The great ones tend to stay on top of their key relation-\nships and keep close tabs on problems or issues as they occur.

For this reason, the world class creates compelling visions \nwritten with great attention to detail and fueled by emotion, and then they think \nabout their vision all the time. The great ones seem to go through four stages of mental \nevolution after creating a world-class vision:  The \uf001rst stage brings them increased mental \nclarity, which occurs as a result of putting their dreams on paper. The second stage is an \nintensi\uf001ed focus on the vision, which occurs \nas a result of the performer thinking about \nthe vision morning, noon and night. The third \nstage turns their intensi\uf001ed focus into a burn-\ning desire, which is often fueled by the frustra-\ntion of seeing and believing the vision is reality \non the mental plane but not yet on the physi-\ncal plane. Champions often develop incredible \nvisualization and self-talk skills that convince \nthe subconscious the vision they project on the \nmovie screen of their mind is real, when at the same time the performers\u2019 conscious mind \nknows it\u2019s not. This creates what psychologists call \u2018cognitive dissonance\u2019, or two thoughts \n(cognitions) that are inconsistent. Since the human mind hates to be inconsistent, it drives \nthe performer to take action and make the vision a reality. This success-driven behavior \ncreates the \uf001nal stage, which occurs when the vision turns into an obsession. Most of \nthe time it\u2019s a healthy obsession, which means the performer is thinking, strategizing and \nmoving closer to her vision every day. When stage four kicks in, failure is no longer an \noption. The champion will do whatever it takes to manifest the vision. The great ones fuel \ntheir obsession by only thinking positive thoughts about their vision, and these thoughts \ncreate psychological, physiological and spiritual energy. At this stage they are no longer \nwilling to entertain thoughts of fear, and will shelter themselves from anything or anyone \nwho approaches them speaking the language of scarcity. In essence, the great ones feed \ntheir vision and starve their fear. \u201cThe world you desire can be won. \nIt exists, it is real, it is possible, it is \nyours.\u201d \n\u2013 Ayn Rand, \n1905-1982, author, philosopher201", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2369, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78523521-2a44-4a2c-acfc-27d950f79f87": {"__data__": {"id_": "78523521-2a44-4a2c-acfc-27d950f79f87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samisabir-idrissi/code/python/streamlit_ai_showcase/data/177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5799440, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e282b52d-6ae3-40fe-9f50-fe49a533f659", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samisabir-idrissi/code/python/streamlit_ai_showcase/data/177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class - Steve Siebold.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5799440, "creation_date": "2024-08-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-02"}, "hash": "46872179feee2c1e08b5d36bc14ff1c9cbc24ec50e03c38037f5ec0dc2ba719c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "177 MENTAL  TOUGHNESS  SECRETS  OF THE WORLD  CLASS\nAction Step for Today: Just for today, decide that you will \nonly think thoughts of love and abundance, especially as they \nrelate to your vision.

When an event occurs, the brain asks \nthree questions: 1) What is it?  2) What does it mean? \n3) What do I do? The answers determine how the \nperformer responds to any given situation. The secret \nthat champions have discovered is that what an event \nmeans is all based on the subjective perception of the \nperformer, and is therefore subject to change. If you change the perception of the event, \nyou automatically change the brain\u2019s response to it. An example would be a salesperson \nfacing rejection day in and day out. The middle-class thinker perceives this rejection to \nmean pain and suffering; the world class perceives it as completely necessary to justify \nbeing paid a large salary and healthy commissions. If the champion had the opportunity \nto remove rejection from the equation, she would refuse to do, it knowing that the job \nwould no longer be worth as much in the marketplace. Instead, she alters her perceptions \nto empower her as a professional performer. The same scenario could apply to someone in \nthe middle of a divorce. The average thinker perceives the divorce as a personal failure; the \nworld-class thinker sees it as a learning experience that will make him tougher and wiser. \nWhich performer is right? Both, because perception, to an emotional creature, is reality. \nIt sometimes appears that the masses allow themselves to suffer for the sake of suffering, \nwhen all they have to do is make a subtle shift in their perceptions and reprogram what \nany given event means to them. While both experiencing the same event, the amateurs are \nsuffering while the pros are dancing in the streets.

In other words, odds are that someone, somewhere, already knows how \nto do whatever the champion wants to do, and can most likely be tapped as a mentor for \nassistance. The critical thinking question is \u201cWhy do I want this vision to become real-\nity?\u201d The intensity of emotion with which this question \nis answered will determine whether the dream comes \nalive or dies. If your house was burning down, would \nyou risk your life to save the furniture? Probably not, \nbut if your kids were trapped inside the house, would \nyou risk your life trying to save them? Of course. The \npoint is we will do anything if the stakes are high \nenough, if we have a big enough reason why. World-\nclass thinkers know this and capitalize on it. While \nmiddle-class thinkers are scaling back their goals and \ndreams because they don\u2019t know how to accomplish \nthem, world-class thinkers are soul searching for their \nemotional motivators. The salesperson who dreams of \nwinning the company trip to Maui and being recog-\nnized on stage in front of his family and peers. The \nmanager who envisions leading her team to record-\nbreaking sales in order to prove to herself that she is as \ngood as she knew she was, even though her stepfather \ntold her that she would never amount to anything. Champions know the secret to world-\nclass motivation lies in emotion. The great ones decide what they want, and more impor-\ntantly, why they want it. They know all bene\uf001ts come down to an emotion that we are \ntrying to create though our goals and dreams, so they invest a lot of mental energy attempt-\ning to identify what emotion they are really after. Once they discover it, the \uf001ght to make \ntheir vision a reality is over before it begins. Obstacles and setbacks are no match for a \nvisionary driven by raw emotion. Ordinary people are transformed into extraordinary per-\nformers who no longer recognize failure as an option. The power of emotional motivation \nis unmistakable, yet only the champions invest the time to tap into it. \u201cSend the harmony of a \ngreat desire vibrating \nthrough every \uf001ber of your \nbeing.

The law of attraction has been written about for \nthousands of years. Secular wisdom de\uf001nes it as the power \nof the subconscious, directed by our dominant thoughts, \nthat attracts people, events and circumstances into our \nlives to ful\uf001ll our visions. Spiritual leaders argue that \ndominant thoughts and prayers attract these same people, \nevents and circumstances through divine intervention. \nWhatever your belief, the one thing all thought leaders \nseem to agree on is this: the law of attraction exists and manifests our dominant thoughts on \nthe physical plane. The great ones know what they think about or give energy to will grow. \nIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s negative, positive or neutral. The law operates without judgment. \nThis is the reason average people barely get by, while the world class lives in abundance. \nThoughts are simply a series of vibrations that grow when supplied with energy. Champi-\nons can lose everything on the physical plane and gain it back very quickly just by bathing \ntheir minds in thoughts of love and abundance. These thoughts lead to belief, and belief \nleads to behavior which creates results. The middle class often misses the concept, while \nthe great ones reap the rewards by obeying this law. \u201cWe attract into our \nlives whatever we give \nour energy, focus, and \nattention to, whether \nwanted or unwanted.\u201d \n\u2013 Michael J.

Many of them \nlearned this lesson the hard way, from experience. \nThey worked day and night to become successful, and \nwhen they arrived, they found it a hollow victory. \nMany discovered they had the equation backwards. \nWhat they should have been doing was seeking ful\uf001llment instead of success, because suc-\ncess almost always follows ful\uf001llment. The best example of this is the secret weapon of the \ngreat ones: They love what they do. They don\u2019t like it \u2013 they love it, and that slight distinc-\ntion makes all the difference. Loving what you do and how you live your life is the founda-\ntion of ful\uf001llment. It\u2019s a lot easier to be successful when you are leading a deeply ful\uf001lling \nlife. Ful\uf001llment is a magnet for success. It creates an extremely high level of vibration, \nbecause it\u2019s rooted in a love-based consciousness. This is why the rich get richer.

In other words, when it comes to interacting with people and prob-\nlem solving, they bypass their egos and tap their spirits.

Most people have never outgrown their adolescence when it \ncomes to controlling their emotions. They are still feeling sorry for themselves and being \nheavily in\uf002uenced by the people around them. Fear \nis an example of this extended adolescence. Children \nare afraid of many things that pose no actual threat to \ntheir well being, such as monsters under the bed or in \nthe closet. The adult masses have the same irrational, \nmade-up fears of events that pose no actual threat, \nyet hold them back from becoming champions. The \nfear of rejection, the fear of public speaking, and the \nfear of success are three examples. When we allow \nourselves to buy into these adolescent fears, we are \nin essence, behaving like children. Champions know \nthat growing up emotionally is essential to achieving \nworld-class results. The great ones still feel fear, but \nchoose to confront their fears and ask themselves if \nthe threat is real or imagined. This critical thinking \nskill enables the champion to move past many of the \nobstacles that stop the middle class before they even get started. Many broken marriages \nare a result of adolescent expectations. The amateur thinker enters the relationship believ-\ning their partner has no faults. As times passes and these faults are revealed, the amateur \nwants to end the relationship and \uf001nd someone with fewer faults. The pros are grown up \nenough to know that all of us are fallible human beings with multiple strengths and weak-\nnesses, and that the successful integration of two lives under one roof takes dedication and \nwork. Professional performers grow up and discover that nothing good comes easy, and if \nit did, we probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate its true value.

This effect is leading \nmany Americans down the road to diabetes, heart dis-\nease and death. So how do the masses solve the prob-\nlem? They swallow pills, go on crash diets, and starve \nthemselves until they can no longer stand it. All these \nmethods treat the effects. They\u2019re an external solution \nto an internal problem. The cause is the way people think about food and exercise, and the \nsolution is to change those thoughts. When those thoughts are upgraded from middle class \nto world class, the weight problem gently fades and never returns. The internal problem \nis solved with an internal solution. Our level of health and \uf001tness, like everything else in \nour lives, is the direct manifestation of how we think. It\u2019s the outward appearance of our \ninternal thoughts. Average thinkers are unaware of this truth, and would most likely reject \nit as being too pedestrian to work even if they were made aware of it. Like most of the \nsecrets of the world class, it\u2019s simple and straightforward. Cause and effect are no different, \nyet the great ones go from knowing this to actually using it.

Were they smarter? More educated? More talented? \nThe answer is no. Oh, I\u2019ve come across a genius or two over the years, but 99% \nof the time, the answer is much simpler. The great ones become great because they are \nmore mentally tough. Through time and effort, they have learned to take control of their \nthoughts, feelings and attitudes in the game of life and in turn, life has rewarded them \nhandsomely. You can do the same thing if \nyou\u2019ll commit yourself to never ending per-\nsonal growth and development. I\u2019ve said this \nmany times throughout this book, but it\u2019s \nworthy of repeating: Champions invest time \nin getting better. School is never out for the \ngreat ones. Have you ever been to the book-\nstore and wondered who reads all those busi-\nness and self-improvement books? It\u2019s not \nthe poverty class, or the working class, or the \nmiddle class. It\u2019s the world class. The people \nwho need it most wouldn\u2019t even consider it, \nand the people who need it least wouldn\u2019t \nconsider missing it. A never-ending cycle of \nself-education is the centerpiece of world-class consciousness. All it takes to get started is a \ndecision to do it.
