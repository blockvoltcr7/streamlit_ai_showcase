# Business Requirements Document: Customized Financial Report API

## Epic: FINAPI-001
**Title**: Develop API Endpoint for Customized Financial Reports

## User Story: FINAPI-001.1
**Title**: As a financial analyst, I want to generate customized financial reports through an API endpoint, so that I can quickly analyze specific financial data based on my criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. The API endpoint should accept HTTP POST requests.
2. The endpoint URL should be `/api/v1/reports/custom`.
3. The request body should accept the following parameters:
   - `report_type`: String (e.g., "income_statement", "balance_sheet", "cash_flow")
   - `start_date`: Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `end_date`: Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `granularity`: String ("daily", "weekly", "monthly", "quarterly", "yearly")
   - `accounts`: Array of account IDs
   - `currencies`: Array of currency codes
   - `include_subtotals`: Boolean
   - `custom_metrics`: Array of custom metric objects

4. The API should validate all input parameters and return appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
5. The API should generate a report based on the specified criteria, querying the necessary data from the financial database.
6. The generated report should be returned in JSON format.
7. The API should support generating reports for at least the following types:
   - Income Statement
   - Balance Sheet
   - Cash Flow Statement

8. The API should apply proper data aggregation based on the specified granularity.
9. The API should handle currency conversions when multiple currencies are specified.
10. The API should calculate and include custom metrics as defined in the request.
11. The API should include subtotals in the report when `include_subtotals` is set to true.
12. The API should return an error if the date range exceeds 5 years.
13. The API should limit the number of accounts that can be included in a single report to 50.
14. The API should return partial results with a warning if some requested data is unavailable.

## Non-functional Requirements:

1. The API should respond within 5 seconds for reports spanning up to 1 year of data.
2. The API should handle up to 100 concurrent requests.
3. The API should be available 99.9% of the time.
4. All API communications should be encrypted using TLS 1.3 or higher.
5. The API should log all requests and responses for auditing purposes.
6. The API should adhere to RESTful design principles.
7. The API should implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## API Response Structure:

```json
{
  "status": "success" | "partial_success" | "error",
  "message": "string",
  "report_data": {
    "report_type": "string",
    "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "granularity": "string",
    "currency": "string",
    "data": [
      {
        "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "accounts": {
          "account_id": "string",
          "account_name": "string",
          "value": "number"
        },
        "subtotals": {
          "category": "string",
          "value": "number"
        },
        "custom_metrics": {
          "metric_name": "string",
          "value": "number"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "warnings": ["string"]
}
```

## Constraints and Assumptions:

1. The API assumes that all financial data is stored in a relational database.
2. The API will use the company's existing authentication and authorization system.
3. All date and time values will be stored and processed in UTC.
4. The API will use the company's standard logging and monitoring tools.
5. The development team will use Java with Spring Boot for implementation.
6. The API documentation will be generated using Swagger/OpenAPI.

## Glossary:

- **Granularity**: The level of detail in the report, e.g., daily, weekly, monthly.
- **Custom Metrics**: User-defined calculations based on standard financial data.
- **Subtotals**: Aggregate values for groups of related accounts.

## Out of Scope:

1. Real-time data updates during report generation.
2. Integration with external data sources.
3. Export of reports to formats other than JSON (e.g., PDF, Excel).
4. User interface for report customization (API only).
